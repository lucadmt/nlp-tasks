Borderline personality disorder (BPD), also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) or borderline pattern personality disorder is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of unstable relationships, distorted sense of self, and strong emotional reactions  Those affected often engage in self-harm and other dangerous behavior  They may also struggle with a feeling of emptiness, fear of abandonment, and detachment from reality  Symptoms of BPD may be triggered by events considered normal to others  BPD typically begins by early adulthood and occurs across a variety of situations  Substance use disorders, depression, and eating disorders are commonly associated with BPD  Approximately  of people affected with the disorder die by suicide  The disorder is often stigmatized in both the media and the psychiatric field 

The causes of BPD are unclear but seem to involve genetic, neurological, environmental, and social factors  It occurs about five times more often in a person who has an affected close relative  Adverse life events appear to also play a role  The underlying mechanism appears to involve the frontolimbic network of neurons  BPD is recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) as a personality disorder, along with nine other such disorders  The condition must be differentiated from an identity problem or substance use disorders, among other possibilities 

BPD is typically treated with psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)  DBT may reduce the risk of suicide in the disorder  Therapy for BPD can occur one-on-one or in a group  While medications cannot cure BPD, they may be used to help with the associated symptoms  Despite no evidence of their effectiveness, SSRI antidepressants and quetiapine remain widely prescribed for the condition  Severe cases of the disorder may require hospital care 

About of people have BPD in a given year, with some estimates as high as   Women are diagnosed about three times as often as men  The disorder appears to become less common among older people  Up to half of those with BPD improve over a ten-year period  Those affected typically use a high amount of healthcare resources  There is an ongoing debate about the naming of the disorder, especially the suitability of the word borderline 
Signs and symptoms

One of the symptoms of BPD is an intense fear of abandonment 

BPD is characterized by nine signs and symptoms  To be diagnosed, a person must meet at least five of the following: 

Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment
Unstable and chaotic interpersonal relationships, often characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation, also known as "splitting"
Markedly disturbed sense of identity and distorted self-image
Impulsive or reckless behaviors (e g , impulsive or uncontrollable spending, unsafe sex, substance use disorders, reckless driving, binge eating)
Recurrent suicidal gestures or self harm
Intense or uncontrollable emotional reactions and rapidly shifting between different emotional states
Chronic feelings of emptiness
Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger
Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms

Overall, the most distinguishing symptoms of BPD are pervasive patterns of instability in interpersonal relationships and self-image, alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation of others, along with varying moods and difficulty regulating strong emotional reactions  Dangerous or impulsive behavior is also correlated with the disorder 

Other symptoms may include feeling unsure of one's identity, morals, and values; having paranoid thoughts when feeling stressed; depersonalization; and, in moderate to severe cases, stress-induced breaks with reality or psychotic episodes  Individuals with BPD often have comorbid conditions, such as depressive and bipolar disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
Emotions

People with BPD may feel emotions with greater ease and depth and for a longer time than others do  A core characteristic of BPD is affective instability, which generally manifests as unusually intense emotional responses to environmental triggers, with a slower return to a baseline emotional state  According to Marsha Linehan, the sensitivity, intensity, and duration with which people with BPD feel emotions have both positive and negative effects  People with BPD are often exceptionally enthusiastic, idealistic, joyful, and loving, but may feel overwhelmed by negative emotions (anxiety, depression, guilt/shame, worry, anger, etc ), experiencing intense grief instead of sadness, shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment, rage instead of annoyance, and panic instead of nervousness  BPD is believed to be the one psychiatric disorder that produces the most intense psychological pain and distress in those who suffer with this condition  Studies have shown that borderline patients experience chronic and significant emotional suffering and mental agony 

People with BPD are also especially sensitive to feelings of rejection, criticism, isolation, and perceived failure  Before learning other coping mechanisms, their efforts to manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to emotional isolation, self-injury or suicidal behavior  They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and, since they cannot regulate them, shut them down entirely since awareness would only cause further distress  This can be harmful since negative emotions alert people to the presence of a problematic situation and move them to address it 

While people with BPD feel euphoria (ephemeral or occasional intense joy), they are especially prone to dysphoria (a profound state of unease or dissatisfaction), depression, and/or feelings of mental and emotional distress  Zanarini et al  recognized four categories of dysphoria typical of this condition: extreme emotions, destructiveness or self-destructiveness, feeling fragmented or lacking identity, and feelings of victimization  Within these categories, a BPD diagnosis is strongly associated with a combination of three specific states: feeling betrayed, feeling out of control, and "feeling like hurting myself"  Since there is great variety in the types of dysphoria people with BPD experience, the amplitude of the distress is a helpful indicator 

In addition to intense emotions, people with BPD experience emotional "lability" (changeability, or fluctuation)  Although that term suggests rapid changes between depression and elation, mood swings in people with BPD more frequently involve anxiety, with fluctuations between anger and anxiety and between depression and anxiety 
Interpersonal relationships

People with BPD can be very sensitive to the way others treat them, by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness  People with BPD often engage in idealization and devaluation of others, alternating between high positive regard for people and great disappointment in them  Their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment, a threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem in the eyes of someone they value  This phenomenon is sometimes called splitting  Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers 

While strongly desiring intimacy, people with BPD tend toward insecure, avoidant or ambivalent, or fearfully preoccupied attachment patterns in relationships, and often view the world as dangerous and malevolent 

Like other personality disorders, BPD is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict in romantic relationships, decreased satisfaction of romantic partners, abuse, and unwanted pregnancy 
Behavior

Impulsive behavior is common, including substance use disorders (e g , alcohol use disorder), eating in excess, unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with multiple partners, reckless spending, and reckless driving  Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury  People with BPD might do this because it gives them the feeling of immediate relief from their emotional pain, but in the long term may feel shame and guilt over consequences of this behavior  A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain, feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain  As time goes on, impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain 
Self-harm and suicide

Scarring as a result of self-harm, which is a common sign in borderline personality disorder 

Self-harming or suicidal behavior is one of the core diagnostic criteria in the DSM-  Self-harm occurs in  to  of people with BPD  The most frequent method of self-harm is cutting  Bruising, burning, head banging or biting are not uncommon with BPD  People with BPD may feel emotional relief after cutting themselves 

The estimation of lifetime risk of suicide among people with BPD varied - depending on method of investigation - between  and   There is evidence that men diagnosed with BPD are approximately twice as likely to die by suicide as women diagnosed with BPD  There is also evidence that a considerable percentage of men who die by suicide may have undiagnosed BPD 

The reported reasons for self-harm differ from the reasons for suicide attempts  Nearly  of people with BPD self-harm without trying to end their lives  Reasons for self-harm include expressing anger, self-punishment, generating normal feelings (often in response to dissociation), and distracting oneself from emotional pain or difficult circumstances  In contrast, suicide attempts typically reflect a belief that others will be better off following the suicide  Suicide and self-harm are responses to feeling negative emotions  Sexual abuse can be a particular trigger for suicidal behavior in adolescents with BPD tendencies 
Sense of self

People with BPD tend to have trouble seeing their identity clearly  In particular, they tend to have difficulty knowing what they value, believe, prefer, and enjoy  They are often unsure about their long-term goals for relationships and jobs  This can cause people with BPD to feel "empty" and "lost"  Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy  People with BPD may base their identity on others, leading to chameleon-like changes in identity 
Cognitions

The often intense emotions people with BPD experience can make it difficult for them to concentrate  They may also tend to dissociate, which can be thought of as an intense form of "zoning out"  Others can sometimes tell when someone with BPD is dissociating because their facial or vocal expressions may become flat or expressionless, or they may appear distracted 

Dissociation often occurs in response to a painful event (or something that triggers the memory of a painful event)  It involves the mind automatically redirecting attention away from that event—presumably to protect against intense emotion and unwanted behavioral impulses that such emotion might trigger  The mind's habit of blocking out intense painful emotions may provide temporary relief, but it can also have the side effect of blocking or blunting ordinary emotions, reducing the access of people with BPD to the information those emotions provide, information that helps guide effective decision-making in daily life 
Psychotic symptoms

Though BPD is primarily seen as a disorder of emotional regulation, psychotic symptoms are fairly common, with an estimated prevalence in clinical BPD populations  These symptoms are sometimes referred to as “pseudo-psychotic” or “psychotic-like,” terms that suggest a distinction from those seen in primary psychotic disorders  Recent research, however, has indicated that there is more similarity between pseudo-psychotic symptoms in BPD and “true” psychosis than originally thought  Some researchers critique the concept of pseudo-psychosis for, on top of weak construct validity, the implication that it’s “not true” or “less severe,” which could trivialize distress and serve as a barrier to diagnosis and treatment  Some researchers have suggested classifying these BPD symptoms as “true” psychosis, or even eliminating the distinction between pseudo-psychosis and true psychosis altogether 

The DSM-V recognizes transient paranoia that worsens in response to stress as a symptom of BPD  Studies have documented both hallucinations and delusions in BPD patients who lack another diagnosis that would better account for those symptoms  Phenomenologically, research suggests that auditory verbal hallucinations found in patients with BPD cannot be reliably distinguished from those seen in schizophrenia  Some researchers suggest there may be a common etiology underlying hallucinations in BPD and those in other conditions like psychotic and affective disorders 
Disability

Many people with BPD are able to work if they find appropriate jobs and their condition is not too severe  People with BPD may be found to have a disability in the workplace if the condition is severe enough that the behaviors of sabotaging relationships, engaging in risky behaviors or intense anger prevent the person from functioning in their job role 
Causes

As is the case with other mental disorders, the causes of BPD are complex and not fully agreed upon  Evidence suggests that BPD and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be related in some way  Most researchers agree that a history of childhood trauma can be a contributing factor, but less attention has historically been paid to investigating the causal roles played by congenital brain abnormalities, genetics, neurobiological factors, and environmental factors other than trauma 

Social factors include how people interact in their early development with their family, friends, and other children  Psychological factors include the individual's personality and temperament, shaped by their environment and learned coping skills that deal with stress  These different factors together suggest that there are multiple factors that may contribute to the disorder 
Genetics

The heritability of BPD is estimated to be between  to   That is,  to  of the variability in liability underlying BPD in the population can be explained by genetic differences  Twin studies may overestimate the effect of genes on variability in personality disorders due to the complicating factor of a shared family environment  Even so, the researchers of one study concluded that personality disorders "seem to be more strongly influenced by genetic effects than almost any Axis I disorder , and more than most broad personality dimensions"  Moreover, the study found that BPD was estimated to be the third most-heritable personality disorder out of the  personality disorders reviewed  Twin, sibling, and other family studies indicate partial heritability for impulsive aggression, but studies of serotonin-related genes have suggested only modest contributions to behavior 

Families with twins in the Netherlands were participants of an ongoing study by Trull and colleagues, in which  pairs of siblings and  parents were examined to identify the location of genetic traits that influenced the development of BPD  Research collaborators found that genetic material on chromosome  was linked to BPD features  The researchers concluded that "genetic factors play a major role in individual differences of borderline personality disorder features"  These same researchers had earlier concluded in a previous study that  of variation in BPD features was attributable to genetic influences and  was attributable to environmental influences  Genes under investigation as of  include the -repeat polymorphism of the dopamine D receptor (DRD) on chromosome , which has been linked to disorganized attachment, whilst the combined effect of the -repeat polymorphism and the dopamine transporter (DAT) genotype has been linked to abnormalities in inhibitory control, both noted features of BPD  There is a possible connection to chromosome  
Brain abnormalities

A number of neuroimaging studies in BPD have reported findings of reductions in regions of the brain involved in the regulation of stress responses and emotion, affecting the hippocampus, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala, amongst other areas  A smaller number of studies have used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to explore changes in the concentrations of neurometabolites in certain brain regions of BPD patients, looking specifically at neurometabolites such as N-acetylaspartate, creatine, glutamate-related compounds, and choline-containing compounds 

Some studies have identified increased gray matter in areas such as the bilateral supplementary motor area, dentate gyrus, and bilateral precuneus, which extends to the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)  The hippocampus tends to be smaller in people with BPD, as it is in people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  However, in BPD, unlike PTSD, the amygdala also tends to be smaller  This unusually strong activity may explain the unusual strength and longevity of fear, sadness, anger, and shame experienced by people with BPD, as well as their heightened sensitivity to displays of these emotions in others  Given its role in regulating emotional arousal, the relative inactivity of the prefrontal cortex might explain the difficulties people with BPD experience in regulating their emotions and responses to stress 
Neurobiology

Borderline personality disorder has previously been strongly associated with the occurrence of childhood trauma  While many psychiatric diagnoses are believed to be associated with traumatic experiences occurring during critical periods of childhood, specific neurobiological factors have been identified within patients diagnosed with BPD  Dysregulations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and cortisol levels have been intensively studied in individuals who have experienced childhood traumas and have been formally diagnosed with BPD  The HPA axis functions to maintain homeostasis when the body is exposed to stressors but has been found to be dysregulated among individuals with a history of childhood abuse  When the body is exposed to stress, the hypothalamus, specifically the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) releases peptides arginine vasopressin (AVP) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)  When these peptides travel through the body, they stimulate corticotrophic cells, resulting in the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)  ACTH binds to receptors in the adrenal cortex, which stimulates the release of cortisol  Intracellular glucocorticoid receptor subtypes of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and low-affinity type receptor (GR) have been found to mediate the effects of cortisol on different areas of the body  While MRs have high affinity for cortisol and are highly saturated in response to stress, GRs have low affinity for cortisol and bind cortisol at high concentrations when an individual is exposed to a stressor  There have also been associations identified with FKBP polymorphisms, rs and rs in individuals with BPD  For those with BPD who have experienced childhood trauma, rs-T and rs-A have been associated, specifically in individuals with both BPD diagnosis and a history of childhood physical abuse and emotional neglect 
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) regulates cortisol production, which is released in response to stress  Cortisol production tends to be elevated in people with BPD, indicating a hyperactive HPA axis in these individuals  This causes them to experience a greater biological stress response, which might explain their greater vulnerability to irritability  Since traumatic events can increase cortisol production and HPA axis activity, one possibility is that the prevalence of higher than average activity in the HPA axis of people with BPD may simply be a reflection of the higher than average prevalence of traumatic childhood and maturational events among people with BPD 
Estrogen

Individual differences in women's estrogen cycles may be related to the expression of BPD symptoms in female patients  A  study found that women's BPD symptoms were predicted by changes in estrogen levels throughout their menstrual cycles, an effect that remained significant when the results were controlled for a general increase in negative affect 
Developmental factors
Childhood trauma

There is a strong correlation between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD  Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated  Patients with BPD have been found to be significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either sex  They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood  Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings  Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care  Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently  Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver or abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to have experienced sexual abuse by a non-caregiver 

It has been suggested that children who experience chronic early maltreatment and attachment difficulties may go on to develop borderline personality disorder  Writing in the psychoanalytic tradition, Otto Kernberg argues that a child's failure to achieve the developmental task of psychic clarification of self and other and failure to overcome splitting might increase the risk of developing a borderline personality 
Neurological patterns

The intensity and reactivity of a person's negative affectivity, or tendency to feel negative emotions, predicts BPD symptoms more strongly than does childhood sexual abuse  This finding, differences in brain structure (see Brain abnormalities), and the fact that some patients with BPD do not report a traumatic history suggest that BPD is distinct from the post-traumatic stress disorder which frequently accompanies it  Thus, researchers examine developmental causes in addition to childhood trauma 

Research published in January  by Anthony Ruocco at the University of Toronto has highlighted two patterns of brain activity that may underlie the dysregulation of emotion indicated in this disorder:  increased activity in the brain circuits responsible for the experience of heightened emotional pain, coupled with  reduced activation of the brain circuits that normally regulate or suppress these generated painful emotions  These two neural networks are seen to be dysfunctionally operative in the limbic system, but the specific regions vary widely in individuals, which calls for the analysis of more neuroimaging studies 

Also (contrary to the results of earlier studies) sufferers of BPD showed less activation in the amygdala in situations of increased negative emotionality than the control group  John Krystal, editor of the journal Biological Psychiatry, wrote that these results " to the impression that people with borderline personality disorder are 'set-up' by their brains to have stormy emotional lives, although not necessarily unhappy or unproductive lives"  Their emotional instability has been found to correlate with differences in several brain regions 
Mediating and moderating factors
Executive function

While high rejection sensitivity is associated with stronger symptoms of borderline personality disorder, executive function appears to mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms  That is, a group of cognitive processes that include planning, working memory, attention, and problem-solving might be the mechanism through which rejection sensitivity impacts BPD symptoms  A  study found that the relationship between a person's rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms was stronger when executive function was lower and that the relationship was weaker when executive function was higher  This suggests that high executive function might help protect people with high rejection sensitivity against symptoms of BPD  A  study found that problems in working memory might contribute to greater impulsivity in people with BPD 
Family environment

Family environment mediates the effect of child sexual abuse on the development of BPD  An unstable family environment predicts the development of the disorder, while a stable family environment predicts a lower risk  One possible explanation is that a stable environment buffers against its development 
Self-complexity

Self-complexity, or considering one's self to have many different characteristics, may lessen the apparent discrepancy between an actual self and a desired self-image  Higher self-complexity may lead a person to desire more characteristics instead of better characteristics; if there is any belief that characteristics should have been acquired, these may be more likely to have been experienced as examples rather than considered as abstract qualities  The concept of a norm does not necessarily involve the description of the attributes that represent the norm: cognition of the norm may only involve the understanding of "being like", a concrete relation and not an attribute 
Thought suppression

A  study found that thought suppression, or conscious attempts to avoid thinking certain thoughts, mediates the relationship between emotional vulnerability and BPD symptoms  A later study found that the relationship between emotional vulnerability and BPD symptoms is not necessarily mediated by thought suppression  However, this study did find that thought suppression mediates the relationship between an invalidating environment and BPD symptoms 
Developmental theories

Marsha Linehan's biosocial developmental theory of borderline personality disorder suggests that BPD emerges from the combination of an emotionally vulnerable child, and an invalidating environment  Emotional vulnerability may consist of biological, inherited factors that affect a child's temperament  Invalidating environments may include contexts where a child's emotions and needs are neglected, ridiculed, dismissed, or discouraged, or may include contexts of trauma and abuse 

Linehan’s theory was modified by Sheila Crowell, who proposed that impulsivity also plays an important role in the development of BPD  Crowell found that children who are emotionally vulnerable and are exposed to invalidating environments are much more likely to develop BPD if they are also highly impulsive  Both theories describe an interplay between a child’s inherited personality traits and their environment  For example, an emotionally sensitive or impulsive child may be difficult to parent, exacerbating the invalidating environment; conversely, invalidation can make an emotionally sensitive child more reactive and distressed 
Diagnosis

Diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is based on a clinical assessment by a mental health professional  The best method is to present the criteria of the disorder to a person and to ask them if they feel that these characteristics accurately describe them  Actively involving people with BPD in determining their diagnosis can help them become more willing to accept it  Some clinicians prefer not to tell people with BPD what their diagnosis is, either from concern about the stigma attached to this condition or because BPD used to be considered untreatable; it is usually helpful for the person with BPD to know their diagnosis  This helps them know that others have had similar experiences and can point them toward effective treatments 

In general, the psychological evaluation includes asking the patient about the beginning and severity of symptoms, as well as other questions about how symptoms impact the patient's quality of life  Issues of particular note are suicidal ideations, experiences with self-harm, and thoughts about harming others  Diagnosis is based both on the person's report of their symptoms and on the clinician's own observations  Additional tests for BPD can include a physical exam and laboratory tests to rule out other possible triggers for symptoms, such as thyroid conditions or a substance use disorder  The ICD-X manual refers to the disorder as emotionally unstable personality disorder and has similar diagnostic criteria  In the DSM-, the name of the disorder remains the same as in the previous editions 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-) has removed the multiaxial system  Consequently, all disorders, including personality disorders, are listed in Section II of the manual  A person must meet five of nine criteria to receive a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder  The DSM-V defines the main features of the condition as a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect, as well as markedly impulsive behavior  In addition, the DSM-V proposes alternative diagnostic criteria for BPD in section III, "Alternative DSM-V Model for Personality Disorders"  These alternative criteria are based on trait research and include specifying at least four of seven maladaptive traits  According to Marsha Linehan, many mental health professionals find it challenging to diagnose BPD using the DSM-V criteria, since these criteria describe such a wide variety of behaviors  To address this issue, Linehan has grouped the symptoms of BPD under five main areas of dysregulation: emotions, behavior, interpersonal relationships, sense of self, and cognition 
International Classification of Disease

The World Health Organization's ICD-X defines a disorder that is conceptually similar to BPD, called (F ) Emotionally unstable personality disorder  Its two subtypes are described below 
F  Impulsive type

At least three of the following must be present, one of which must be :

marked tendency to act unexpectedly and without consideration of the consequences;
marked tendency to engage in quarrelsome behavior and to have conflicts with others, especially when impulsive acts are thwarted or criticized;
liability to outbursts of anger or violence, with inability to control the resulting behavioral explosions;
difficulty in maintaining any course of action that offers no immediate reward;
unstable and capricious (impulsive, whimsical) mood 

F  Borderline type

At least three of the symptoms mentioned in F  Impulsive type must be present , with at least two of the following in addition:

disturbances in and uncertainty about self-image, aims, and internal preferences;

liable to become involved in intense and unstable relationships, often leading to emotional crisis;

excessive efforts to avoid abandonment;

recurrent threats or acts of self-harm;

chronic feelings of emptiness;

demonstrates impulsive behavior, e g , speeding in a car or substance use 

The ICD-X also describes some general criteria that define what is considered a personality disorder 
Millon's subtypes

American psychologist Theodore Millon has proposed four subtypes of BPD  He suggests that an individual diagnosed with BPD may exhibit none, one, or multiple of the following:

Discouraged borderline (including avoidant and dependent features) 	Pliant, submissive, loyal, humble; feels vulnerable and in constant jeopardy; feels hopeless, depressed, helpless, and powerless 

Petulant borderline (including negativistic features) 	Negativistic, impatient, restless, as well as stubborn, defiant, sullen, pessimistic, and resentful; easily feels "slighted" and quickly disillusioned 

Impulsive borderline (including histrionic or antisocial features) 	Captivating, capricious, superficial, flighty, distractable, frenetic, and seductive; fearing loss, the individual becomes agitated; gloomy and irritable; and potentially suicidal 

Self-destructive borderline (including depressive or masochistic features) 	Inward-turning, intropunitive (self-punishing), angry; conforming, deferential, and ingratiating behaviors have deteriorated; increasingly high-strung and moody; possible suicide 

People with BPD may be misdiagnosed for a variety of reasons  One reason for misdiagnosis is BPD has symptoms that coexist (comorbidity) with other disorders such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and bipolar disorder 
Family members

People with BPD are prone to feeling angry at members of their family and alienated from them  On their part, family members often feel angry and helpless at how their BPD family members relate to them  Parents of adults with BPD are often both over-involved and under-involved in family interactions  In romantic relationships, BPD is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict, decreased satisfaction of romantic partners, domestic abuse, and unwanted pregnancy  However, these links may apply to personality disorders in general 
Adolescence

Onset of symptoms typically occurs during adolescence or young adulthood, although symptoms suggestive of this disorder can sometimes be observed in children  Symptoms among adolescents that predict the development of BPD in adulthood may include problems with body-image, extreme sensitivity to rejection, behavioral problems, non-suicidal self-injury, attempts to find exclusive relationships, and severe shame  Many adolescents experience these symptoms without going on to develop BPD, but those who experience them are  times as likely as their peers to develop BPD  They are also more likely to develop other forms of long-term social disabilities 

BPD is recognised as a valid and stable diagnosis during adolescence  The diagnosis of BPD (also described as "personality disorder: borderline pattern qualifier") in adolescents is supported in recent updates to the international diagnostic and psychiatric classification tools including the DSM-V and ICD-  Early diagnosis of BPD has been recognised as instrumental to the early intervention and effective treatment for BPD in young people  Accordingly, national treatment guidelines recommend the diagnosis and treatment of BPD among adolescents in many countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Switzerland 

The diagnosis of BPD during adolescence has been controversial  Early clinical guidelines encouraged caution when diagnosing BPD during adolescence  Perceived barriers to the diagnosis of BPD during adolescence included concerns about the validity of a diagnosis in young people, the misdiagnosis normal adolescent behaviour as symptoms of BPD, the stigmatising effect of a diagnosis for adolescents, and whether personality during adolescence was sufficiently stable for a valid diagnosis of BPD  Psychiatric research has since shown BPD to be a valid, stable and clinically useful diagnosis in adolescent populations  However, ongoing misconceptions about the diagnosis of BPD in adolescence remain prevalent among mental health professionals  Clinical reluctance to diagnose BPD as a key barrier to the provision of effective treatment in adolescent populations 

A BPD diagnosis in adolescence might predict that the disorder will continue into adulthood  Among individuals diagnosed with BPD during adolescence, there appears to be one group in which the disorder remains stable over time and another group in which the individuals move in and out of the diagnosis  Earlier diagnoses may be helpful in creating a more effective treatment plan for the adolescent  Family therapy is considered a helpful component of treatment for adolescents with BPD 
Differential diagnosis and comorbidity

Lifetime comorbid (co-occurring) conditions are common in BPD  Compared to those diagnosed with other personality disorders, people with BPD showed a higher rate of also meeting criteria for

mood disorders, including major depression and bipolar disorder

anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

other personality disorders, including schizotypal, antisocial and dependent personality disorder

substance use

eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia

attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

somatic symptom disorders (formerly known as somatoform disorders: a category of mental disorders included in a number of diagnostic schemes of mental illness)

dissociative disorders

A diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be made during an untreated mood episode/disorder, unless the lifetime history supports the presence of a personality disorder 
Comorbid Axis I disorders

A  study found that at some point in their lives,  of people with BPD meet criteria for mood disorders, especially major depression and bipolar I, and nearly  meet criteria for an anxiety disorder  Nearly  meet the criteria for a substance use disorder, and about  for PTSD  It is noteworthy that less than half of the participants with BPD in this study presented with PTSD, a prevalence similar to that reported in an earlier study  The finding that less than half of patients with BPD experience PTSD during their lives challenges the theory that BPD and PTSD are the same disorder 

There are marked sex differences in the types of comorbid conditions a person with BPD is likely to have – a higher percentage of males with BPD meet criteria for substance-use disorders, while a higher percentage of females with BPD meet criteria for PTSD and eating disorders  In one study,  of participants with BPD met the criteria for a diagnosis of ADHD  In another study,  of  participants  met the criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (a subgroup that had significantly more frequent suicide attempts) 

Regardless that it is an infradiagnosed disorder, a few studies have shown that the "lower expressions" of it might lead to wrong diagnoses  The many and shifting Axis I disorders in people with BPD can sometimes cause clinicians to miss the presence of the underlying personality disorder  However, since a complex pattern of Axis I diagnoses has been found to strongly predict the presence of BPD, clinicians can use the feature of a complex pattern of comorbidity as a clue that BPD might be present 
Mood disorders

Many people with borderline personality disorder also have mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder or a bipolar disorder  Some characteristics of BPD are similar to those of mood disorders, which can complicate the diagnosis  It is especially common for people to be misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder when they have borderline personality disorder or vice versa  For someone with bipolar disorder, behavior suggestive of BPD might appear while experiencing an episode of major depression or mania, only to disappear once mood has stabilized  For this reason, it is ideal to wait until mood has stabilized before attempting to make a diagnosis 

At face value, the affective lability of BPD and the rapid mood cycling of bipolar disorders can seem very similar  It can be difficult even for experienced clinicians, if they are unfamiliar with BPD, to differentiate between the mood swings of these two conditions  However, there are some clear differences 

First, the mood swings of BPD and bipolar disorder tend to have different durations  In some people with bipolar disorder, episodes of depression or mania last for at least two weeks at a time, which is much longer than moods last in people with BPD  Even among those who experience bipolar disorder with more rapid mood shifts, their moods usually last for days, while the moods of people with BPD can change in minutes or hours  So while euphoria and impulsivity in someone with BPD might resemble a manic episode, the experience would be too brief to qualify as a manic episode 

Second, the moods of bipolar disorder do not respond to changes in the environment, while the moods of BPD do respond to changes in the environment  That is, a positive event would not lift the depressed mood caused by bipolar disorder, but a positive event would potentially lift the depressed mood of someone with BPD  Similarly, an undesirable event would not dampen the euphoria caused by bipolar disorder, but an undesirable event would dampen the euphoria of someone with borderline personality disorder 

Third, when people with BPD experience euphoria, it is usually without the racing thoughts and decreased need for sleep that are typical of hypomania, though a later  study of data collected in  found that borderline personality disorder diagnosis and symptoms were associated with chronic sleep disturbances, including difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and waking earlier than desired, as well as with the consequences of poor sleep, and noted that "ew studies have examined the experience of chronic sleep disturbances in those with borderline personality disorder" 

Because the two conditions have a number of similar symptoms, BPD was once considered to be a mild form of bipolar disorder or to exist on the bipolar spectrum  However, this would require that the underlying mechanism causing these symptoms be the same for both conditions  Differences in phenomenology, family history, longitudinal course, and responses to treatment suggest that this is not the case  Researchers have found "only a modest association" between bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, with "a strong spectrum relationship with  bipolar disorder extremely unlikely"  Benazzi et al  suggest that the DSM-IV BPD diagnosis combines two unrelated characteristics: an affective instability dimension related to bipolar II and an impulsivity dimension not related to bipolar II 

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) occurs in – of women  Symptoms begin during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, and end during menstruation  Symptoms may include marked mood swings, irritability, depressed mood, feeling hopeless or suicidal, a subjective sense of being overwhelmed or out of control, anxiety, binge eating, difficulty concentrating, and substantial impairment of interpersonal relationships  People with PMDD typically begin to experience symptoms in their early twenties, although many do not seek treatment until their early thirties 

Although some of the symptoms of PMDD and BPD are similar, they are different disorders  They are distinguishable by the timing and duration of symptoms, which are markedly different: the symptoms of PMDD occur only during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, whereas BPD symptoms occur persistently at all stages of the menstrual cycle  In addition, the symptoms of PMDD do not include impulsivity 
Comorbid Axis II disorders

About three-fourths of people diagnosed with BPD also meet the criteria for another Axis II personality disorder at some point in their lives  (In a major  study – see adjacent table – the rate was  ) The Cluster A disorders, paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal, are broadly the most common  The Cluster as a whole affects about half, with schizotypal alone affecting one third 

BPD is itself a Cluster B disorder  The other Cluster B disorders, antisocial, histrionic, and narcissistic, similarly affect about half of BPD patients (lifetime incidence), with again narcissistic affecting one third or more  Cluster C, avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive, showed the least overlap, slightly under one third 
Management

Psychotherapy is the primary treatment for borderline personality disorder  Treatments should be based on the needs of the individual, rather than upon the general diagnosis of BPD  Medications are useful for treating comorbid disorders, such as depression and anxiety  Short-term hospitalization has not been found to be more effective than community care for improving outcomes or long-term prevention of suicidal behavior in those with BPD 

Long-term psychotherapy is currently the treatment of choice for BPD  While psychotherapy, in particular dialectical behavior therapy and psychodynamic approaches, is effective, the effects are slow: many people have to put in years of work to be effective 

More rigorous treatments are not substantially better than less rigorous treatments  There are six such treatments available: dynamic deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP), mentalization-based treatment (MBT), transference-focused psychotherapy, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), general psychiatric management, and schema-focused therapy  Long-term therapy of any kind is better than no treatment, especially in reducing urges to self-injure 

Transference-focused therapy aims to break away from absolute thinking  In this, it gets the people to articulate their social interpretations and their emotions in order to turn their views into less rigid categories  The therapist addresses the individual's feelings and goes over situations, real or realistic, that could happen as well as how to approach them 

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) has similar components to CBT, adding in practices such as meditation  In doing this, it helps the individual with BPD gain skills to manage symptoms  These skills include emotion regulation, mindfulness, and stress hardiness  Since those diagnosed with BPD have such intense emotions, learning to regulate them is a huge step in the therapeutic process  Some components of DBT are working long-term with patients, building skills to understand and regulate emotions, homework assignments, and strong availability of therapist to their client  Patients with borderline personality disorder also must take time in DBT to work with their therapist to learn how to get through situations surrounded by intense emotions or stress as well as learning how to better their interpersonal relationships 

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also a type of psychotherapy used for treatment of BPD  This type of therapy relies on changing people's behaviors and beliefs by identifying problems from the disorder  CBT is known to reduce some anxiety and mood symptoms as well as reduce suicidal thoughts and self-harming behaviors 

Mentalization-based therapy and transference-focused psychotherapy are based on psychodynamic principles, and dialectical behavior therapy is based on cognitive-behavioral principles and mindfulness  General psychiatric management combines the core principles from each of these treatments, and it is considered easier to learn and less intensive  Randomized controlled trials have shown that DBT and MBT may be the most effective, and the two share many similarities  Researchers are interested in developing shorter versions of these therapies to increase accessibility, to relieve the financial burden on patients, and to relieve the resource burden on treatment providers 

Some research indicates that mindfulness meditation may bring about favorable structural changes in the brain, including changes in brain structures that are associated with BPD  Mindfulness-based interventions also appear to bring about an improvement in symptoms characteristic of BPD, and some clients who underwent mindfulness-based treatment no longer met a minimum of five of the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for BPD 
Medications

A  review by the Cochrane collaboration found that no medications show promise for "the core BPD symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance, and abandonment"  However, the authors found that some medications may impact isolated symptoms associated with BPD or the symptoms of comorbid conditions  A  review examined evidence published since the  Cochrane review and found that "evidence of effectiveness of medication for BPD remains very mixed and is still highly compromised by suboptimal study design"  A  review found that research into pharmacological treatments had declined, with more results confirming no benefits  Despite lack of evidence of benefit, quetiapine and SSRI antidepressants continue to be widely prescribed to people with BPD 

Of the typical antipsychotics studied in relation to BPD, haloperidol may reduce anger and flupenthixol may reduce the likelihood of suicidal behavior  Among the atypical antipsychotics, one trial found that aripiprazole may reduce interpersonal problems and impulsivity  Olanzapine, as well as quetiapine, may decrease affective instability, anger, psychotic paranoid symptoms, and anxiety, but a placebo had a greater benefit on suicidal ideation than olanzapine did  The effect of ziprasidone was not significant 

Of the mood stabilizers studied, valproate semisodium may ameliorate depression, impulsivity, interpersonal problems, and anger  Topiramate may ameliorate interpersonal problems, impulsivity, anxiety, anger, and general psychiatric pathology  The effect of carbamazepine was not significant  Of the antidepressants, amitriptyline may reduce depression, but mianserin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and phenelzine sulfate showed no effect  Omega- fatty acid may ameliorate suicidality and improve depression  As of , trials with these medications had not been replicated and the effect of long-term use had not been assessed  Lamotrigine showed no benefit in a large randomized clinical trial 

Because of weak evidence and the potential for serious side effects from some of these medications, the United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)  clinical guideline for the treatment and management of BPD recommends, "Drug treatment should not be used specifically for borderline personality disorder or for the individual symptoms or behavior associated with the disorder " However, "drug treatment may be considered in the overall treatment of comorbid conditions"  They suggest a "review of the treatment of people with borderline personality disorder who do not have a diagnosed comorbid mental or physical illness and who are currently being prescribed drugs, with the aim of reducing and stopping unnecessary drug treatment" 
Services

There is a significant difference between the number of those who would benefit from treatment and the number of those who are treated  The so-called "treatment gap" is a function of the disinclination of the afflicted to submit for treatment, an underdiagnosing of the disorder by healthcare providers, and the limited availability and access to state-of-the-art treatments  Nonetheless, individuals with BPD accounted for about  of psychiatric hospitalizations in one survey  The majority of individuals with BPD who are in treatment continue to use outpatient treatment in a sustained manner for several years, but the number using the more restrictive and costly forms of treatment, such as inpatient admission, declines with time 

Experience of services varies  Assessing suicide risk can be a challenge for clinicians, and patients themselves tend to underestimate the lethality of self-injurious behaviors  People with BPD typically have a chronically elevated risk of suicide much above that of the general population and a history of multiple attempts when in crisis  Approximately half the individuals who commit suicide meet criteria for a personality disorder  Borderline personality disorder remains the most commonly associated personality disorder with suicide 

After a patient suffering from BPD died, The National Health Service (NHS) in England was criticized by a coroner in  for the lack of commissioned services to support those with BPD  Evidence was given that  of female patients had BPD and there was no provision or priority for therapeutic psychological services  At the time, there were only a total of  specialized inpatient beds in England, all of them located in London or the northeast region 
Prognosis

With treatment, the majority of people with BPD can find relief from distressing symptoms and achieve remission, defined as a consistent relief from symptoms for at least two years  A longitudinal study tracking the symptoms of people with BPD found that   achieved remission within two years from the beginning of the study  Within four years,   had achieved remission, and within six years,   had achieved remission  By the end of the study,   of participants were found to be in remission  Moreover, of those who achieved recovery from symptoms, only   experienced recurrences  A later study found that ten years from baseline (during a hospitalization),  of patients had sustained a stable recovery from symptoms 

Patient personality can play an important role during the therapeutic process, leading to better clinical outcomes  Recent research has shown that BPD patients undergoing dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) exhibit better clinical outcomes correlated with higher levels of the trait of agreeableness in the patient, compared to patients either low in agreeableness or not being treated with DBT  This association was mediated through the strength of a working alliance between patient and therapist; that is, more agreeable patients developed stronger working alliances with their therapists, which in turn, led to better clinical outcomes 

In addition to recovering from distressing symptoms, people with BPD also achieve high levels of psychosocial functioning  A longitudinal study tracking the social and work abilities of participants with BPD found that six years after diagnosis,  of participants had good function in work and social environments, compared to  of participants when they were first diagnosed  Vocational achievement was generally more limited, even compared to those with other personality disorders  However, those whose symptoms had remitted were significantly more likely to have good relationships with a romantic partner and at least one parent, good performance at work and school, a sustained work and school history, and good psychosocial functioning overall 
Epidemiology

The prevalence of BPD was estimated in the mid-s to be – of the general population and to occur three times more often in women than in men  However, the lifetime prevalence of BPD, as defined in the DSM-IV, in a  study was found to be   of the American population, occurring in   of men and   of women  The difference in rates between men and women in this study was not found to be statistically significant 

Borderline personality disorder is estimated to contribute to  of psychiatric hospitalizations and to occur among  of outpatients 

  of new inmates in the U S  state of Iowa fit a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder in , and the overall prevalence of BPD in the U S  prison population is thought to be   These high numbers may be related to the high frequency of substance use and substance use disorders among people with BPD, which is estimated at  
History

Devaluation in Edvard Munch's Salome   Idealization and devaluation of others in personal relations is a common trait in BPD  The painter Edvard Munch depicted his new friend, the violinist Eva Mudocci, in both ways within days  First as "a woman seen by a man in love", then as "a bloodthirsty and cannibalistic Salome"  In modern times, Munch has been diagnosed as having had BPD 

The coexistence of intense, divergent moods within an individual was recognized by Homer, Hippocrates, and Aretaeus, the latter describing the vacillating presence of impulsive anger, melancholia, and mania within a single person  The concept was revived by Swiss physician Théophile Bonet in  who, using the term folie maniaco-mélancolique, described the phenomenon of unstable moods that followed an unpredictable course  Other writers noted the same pattern, including the American psychiatrist Charles H  Hughes in  and J  C  Rosse in , who called the disorder "borderline insanity"  In , Kraepelin identified an "excitable personality" that closely parallels the borderline features outlined in the current concept of BPD 

The first significant psychoanalytic work to use the term "borderline" was written by Adolf Stern in   It described a group of patients suffering from what he thought to be a mild form of schizophrenia, on the borderline between neurosis and psychosis 

The s and s saw a shift from thinking of the condition as borderline schizophrenia to thinking of it as a borderline affective disorder (mood disorder), on the fringes of bipolar disorder, cyclothymia, and dysthymia  In the DSM-II, stressing the intensity and variability of moods, it was called cyclothymic personality (affective personality)  While the term "borderline" was evolving to refer to a distinct category of disorder, psychoanalysts such as Otto Kernberg were using it to refer to a broad spectrum of issues, describing an intermediate level of personality organization between neurosis and psychosis 

After standardized criteria were developed to distinguish it from mood disorders and other Axis I disorders, BPD became a personality disorder diagnosis in  with the publication of the DSM-III  The diagnosis was distinguished from sub-syndromal schizophrenia, which was termed "schizotypal personality disorder"  The DSM-IV Axis II Work Group of the American Psychiatric Association finally decided on the name "borderline personality disorder", which is still in use by the DSM-V today  However, the term "borderline" has been described as uniquely inadequate for describing the symptoms characteristic of this disorder 

Earlier versions of the DSM—before the multiaxial diagnosis system—classified most people with mental health problems into two categories, the psychotics and the neurotics  Clinicians noted a certain class of neurotics who, when in crisis, appeared to straddle the borderline into psychosis  The term "borderline personality disorder" was coined in American psychiatry in the s  It became the preferred term over a number of competing names, such as "emotionally unstable character disorder" and "borderline schizophrenia" during the s  Borderline personality disorder was included in DSM-III despite not being universally recognized as a valid diagnosis 

The credibility of individuals with personality disorders has been questioned at least since the s : Two concerns are the incidence of dissociation episodes among people with BPD and the belief that lying is a key component of this condition 

Researchers disagree about whether dissociation, or a sense of detachment from emotions and physical experiences, impacts the ability of people with BPD to recall the specifics of past events  A  study reported that the specificity of autobiographical memory was decreased in BPD patients  The researchers found that decreased ability to recall specifics was correlated with patients' levels of dissociation 

Some theorists argue that patients with BPD often lie  However, others write that they have rarely seen lying among patients with BPD in clinical practice 

Since BPD can be a stigmatizing diagnosis even within the mental health community, some survivors of childhood abuse who are diagnosed with BPD are re-traumatized by the negative responses they receive from healthcare providers  One camp argues that it would be better to diagnose these men or women with post-traumatic stress disorder, as this would acknowledge the impact of abuse on their behavior  Critics of the PTSD diagnosis argue that it medicalizes abuse rather than addressing the root causes in society  Regardless, a diagnosis of PTSD does not encompass all aspects of the disorder (see brain abnormalities and terminology) 

Joel Paris states that "In the clinic   Up to  of patients are women  That may not be true in the community " He offers the following explanations regarding these sex discrepancies:

The most probable explanation for gender differences in clinical samples is that women are more likely to develop the kind of symptoms that bring patients in for treatment  Twice as many women as men in the community suffer from depression (Weissman & Klerman, )  In contrast, there is a preponderance of men meeting the criteria for substance use disorder and psychopathy (Robins & Regier, ), and males with these disorders do not necessarily present in the mental health system  Men and women with similar psychological problems may express distress differently  Men tend to drink more and carry out more crimes  Women tend to turn their anger on themselves, leading to depression as well as the cutting and overdosing that characterize BPD  Thus, anti-social personality disorder (ASPD) and borderline personality disorders might derive from similar underlying pathology but present with symptoms strongly influenced by gender (Paris, a; Looper & Paris, )  We have even more specific evidence that men with BPD may not seek help  In a study of completed suicides among people aged  to  years (Lesage et al , ),  of the suicides involved individuals with BPD (as confirmed by psychological autopsy, in which symptoms were assessed by interviews with family members)  Most of the suicide completers were men, and very few were in treatment  Similar findings emerged from a later study conducted by our own research group (McGirr, Paris, Lesage, Renaud, & Turecki, ) 

In short, men are less likely to seek or accept appropriate treatment, more likely to be treated for symptoms of BPD such as substance use rather than BPD itself (the symptoms of BPD and ASPD possibly deriving from a similar underlying etiology), possibly more likely to wind up in the correctional system due to criminal behavior, and possibly more likely to commit suicide prior to diagnosis 

Among men diagnosed with BPD there is also evidence of a higher suicide rate: "men are more than twice as likely as women— percent versus  percent"—to die by suicide 

There are also sex differences in borderline personality disorders  Men with BPD are more likely to recreationally use substances, have explosive temper, high levels of novelty seeking and have anti-social, narcissistic, passive-aggressive or sadistic personality traits  Women with BPD are more likely to have eating disorders, mood disorders, anxiety and post-traumatic stress 

Manipulative behavior to obtain nurturance is considered by the DSM-IV-TR and many mental health professionals to be a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder  However, Marsha Linehan notes that doing so relies upon the assumption that people with BPD who communicate intense pain, or who engage in self-harm and suicidal behavior, do so with the intention of influencing the behavior of others  The impact of such behavior on others—often an intense emotional reaction in concerned friends, family members, and therapists—is thus assumed to have been the person's intention 

However, their frequent expressions of intense pain, self-harming, or suicidal behavior may instead represent a method of mood regulation or an escape mechanism from situations that feel unbearable 

The features of BPD include emotional instability; intense, unstable interpersonal relationships; a need for intimacy; and a fear of rejection  As a result, people with BPD often evoke intense emotions in those around them  Pejorative terms to describe people with BPD, such as "difficult", "treatment resistant", "manipulative", "demanding", and "attention seeking", are often used and may become a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the negative treatment of these individuals triggers further self-destructive behavior 

The stigma surrounding borderline personality disorder includes the belief that people with BPD are prone to violence toward others  While movies and visual media often sensationalize people with BPD by portraying them as violent, the majority of researchers agree that people with BPD are unlikely to physically harm others  Although people with BPD often struggle with experiences of intense anger, a defining characteristic of BPD is that they direct it inward toward themselves  One of the key differences between BPD and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is that people with BPD tend to internalize anger by hurting themselves, while people with ASPD tend to externalize it by hurting others 

One  study found that BPD is individually associated with psychological, physical and sexual forms of intimate partner violence, especially amongst men  In terms of the AMPD trait facets, hostility (negative affectivity), suspiciousness (negative affectivity) and risk taking (disinhibition) were most strongly associated with IPV perpetration for the total sample 

In addition, adults with BPD have often experienced abuse in childhood, so many people with BPD adopt a "no-tolerance" policy toward expressions of anger of any kind  Their extreme aversion to violence can cause many people with BPD to overcompensate and experience difficulties being assertive and expressing their needs  This is one way in which people with BPD choose to harm themselves over potentially causing harm to others  Another way in which people with BPD avoid expressing their anger through violence is by causing physical damage to themselves, such as engaging in non-suicidal self-injury 

People with BPD are considered to be among the most challenging groups of patients to work with in therapy, requiring a high level of skill and training for the psychiatrists, therapists, and nurses involved in their treatment  A majority of psychiatric staff report finding individuals with BPD moderately to extremely difficult to work with and more difficult than other client groups  This largely negative view of BPD can result in people with BPD being terminated from treatment early, being provided harmful treatment, not being informed of their diagnosis of BPD, or being misdiagnosed  With healthcare providers contributing to the stigma of a BPD diagnosis, seeking treatment can often result in the perpetuation of BPD features  Efforts are ongoing to improve public and staff attitudes toward people with BPD 

In psychoanalytic theory, the stigmatization among mental health care providers may be thought to reflect countertransference (when a therapist projects his or her own feelings on to a client)  Thus, a diagnosis of BPD often says more about the clinician's negative reaction to the patient than it does about the patient and explains away the breakdown in empathy between the therapist and the patient and becomes an institutional epithet in the guise of pseudoscientific jargon  This inadvertent countertransference can give rise to inappropriate clinical responses, including excessive use of medication, inappropriate mothering, and punitive use of limit setting and interpretation 

Some clients feel the diagnosis is helpful, allowing them to understand that they are not alone and to connect with others with BPD who have developed helpful coping mechanisms  However, others experience the term "borderline personality disorder" as a pejorative label rather than an informative diagnosis  They report concerns that their self-destructive behavior is incorrectly perceived as manipulative and that the stigma surrounding this disorder limits their access to health care  Indeed, mental health professionals frequently refuse to provide services to those who have received a BPD diagnosis 

Because of concerns around stigma, and because of a move away from the original theoretical basis for the term (see history), there is ongoing debate about renaming borderline personality disorder  While some clinicians agree with the current name, others argue that it should be changed, since many who are labelled with borderline personality disorder find the name unhelpful, stigmatizing, or inaccurate  Valerie Porr, president of Treatment and Research Advancement Association for Personality Disorders states that "the name BPD is confusing, imparts no relevant or descriptive information, and reinforces existing stigma" 

Alternative suggestions for names include emotional regulation disorder or emotional dysregulation disorder  Impulse disorder and interpersonal regulatory disorder are other valid alternatives, according to John G  Gunderson of McLean Hospital in the United States  Another term suggested by psychiatrist Carolyn Quadrio is post traumatic personality disorganization (PTPD), reflecting the condition's status as (often) both a form of chronic post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as a personality disorder  However, although many with BPD do have traumatic histories, some do not report any kind of traumatic event, which suggests that BPD is not necessarily a trauma spectrum disorder 

The Treatment and Research Advancements National Association for Personality Disorders (TARA-APD) campaigned unsuccessfully to change the name and designation of BPD in DSM-, published in May , in which the name "borderline personality disorder" remains unchanged and it is not considered a trauma- and stressor-related disorder 

In literature, characters with behavior consistent with borderline personality disorder include Catherine in Wuthering Heights , Smerdyakov in The Brothers Karamazov , and Harry Haller in Steppenwolf  

Films attempting to depict characters with the disorder include A Thin Line Between Love and Hate , Filth , Fatal Attraction , The Crush , Mad Love , Malicious , Interiors , The Cable Guy , Mr  Nobody , Moksha , Margot at the Wedding , Cracks , and Welcome to Me  

Robert O  Friedel has suggested that the behavior of Theresa Dunn, the leading character of Looking for Mr  Goodbar  is consistent with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder 

The films Play Misty for Me  and Girl, Interrupted (, based on the memoir of the same name) both suggest the emotional instability of the disorder 

The film Single White Female , like the first example, also suggests characteristics, some of which are actually atypical of the disorder: the character Hedy had markedly disturbed sense of identity and reacts drastically to abandonment :

Multiple commenters have noted that Clementine in Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind  shows classic borderline personality disorder behavior  

In a review of the film Shame  for the British journal The Art of Psychiatry, another psychiatrist, Abby Seltzer, praises Carey Mulligan's portrayal of a character with the disorder even though it is never mentioned onscreen 

Psychiatrists Eric Bui and Rachel Rodgers argue that the Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader character in the Star Wars films meets six of the nine diagnostic criteria; Bui also found Anakin a useful example to explain BPD to medical students  In particular, Bui points to the character's abandonment issues, uncertainty over his identity, and dissociative episodes 

On television, The CW show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend portrays the main character, played by Rachel Bloom, with borderline personality disorder,  and Emma Stone's character in the Netflix miniseries Maniac is diagnosed with the disorder  Additionally, incestuous twins Cersei and Jaime Lannister, in George R  R  Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series and its television adaptation, Game of Thrones, have traits of borderline and narcissistic personality disorders 

In early , the United States House of Representatives declared the month of May Borderline Personality Disorder Awareness Month 

In , South Korean singer-songwriter Lee Sunmi spoke out about her struggle with borderline personality disorder on the show Running Mates, having been diagnosed  years prior

Paranoid personality disorder (PPD) is a mental illness characterized by paranoid delusions, and a pervasive, long-standing suspiciousness and generalized mistrust of others  People with this personality disorder may be hypersensitive, easily insulted, and habitually relate to the world by vigilant scanning of the environment for clues or suggestions that may validate their fears or biases  They are eager observers  They think they are in danger and look for signs and threats of that danger, potentially not appreciating other interpretations or evidence 

They tend to be guarded and suspicious and have quite constricted emotional lives  Their reduced capacity for meaningful emotional involvement and the general pattern of isolated withdrawal often lend a quality of schizoid isolation to their life experience  People with PPD may have a tendency to bear grudges, suspiciousness, tendency to interpret others' actions as hostile, persistent tendency to self-reference, or a tenacious sense of personal right  Patients with this disorder can also have significant comorbidity with other personality disorders (such as schizotypal, schizoid, narcissistic, avoidant and borderline) 

A genetic contribution to paranoid traits and a possible genetic link between this personality disorder and schizophrenia exist  A large long-term Norwegian twin study found paranoid personality disorder to be modestly heritable and to share a portion of its genetic and environmental risk factors with the other cluster A personality disorders, schizoid and schizotypal 

Psychosocial theories implicate projection of negative internal feelings and parental modeling  Cognitive theorists believe the disorder to be a result of an underlying belief that other people are unfriendly in combination with a lack of self-awareness 

The World Health Organization's ICD-X lists paranoid personality disorder under (F )  It is a requirement of ICD-X that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of general personality disorder criteria  It is also pointed out that for different cultures it may be necessary to develop specific sets of criteria with regard to social norms, rules and other obligations 

PPD is characterized by at least three of the following symptoms:

excessive sensitivity to setbacks and rebuffs;

tendency to bear grudges persistently (i e  refusal to forgive insults and injuries or slights);

suspiciousness and a pervasive tendency to distort experience by misconstruing the neutral or friendly actions of others as hostile or contemptuous;

a combative and tenacious sense of self-righteousness out of keeping with the actual situation;

recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding sexual fidelity of spouse or sexual partner;

tendency to experience excessive self-aggrandizing, manifest in a persistent self-referential attitude;

preoccupation with unsubstantiated "conspiratorial" explanations of events both immediate to the patient and in the world at large 

Includes: expansive paranoid, fanatic, querulant and sensitive paranoid personality disorder 

Excludes: delusional disorder and schizophrenia 

The American Psychiatric Association's DSM-V has similar criteria for paranoid personality disorder  They require in general the presence of lasting distrust and suspicion of others, interpreting their motives as malevolent, from an early adult age, occurring in a range of situations  Four of seven specific issues must be present, which include different types of suspicions or doubt (such as of being exploited, or that remarks have a subtle threatening meaning), in some cases regarding others in general or specifically friends or partners, and in some cases referring to a response of holding grudges or reacting angrily 

PPD is characterized by a pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their motives are interpreted as malevolent, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts  To qualify for a diagnosis, the patient must meet at least four out of the following criteria:

Suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them 

Is preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends or associates 

Is reluctant to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against them 

Reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or events 

Persistently bears grudges (i e , is unforgiving of insults, injuries, or slights) 

Perceives attacks on their character or reputation that are not apparent to others and is quick to react angrily or to counterattack 

Has recurrent suspicions, without justification, regarding fidelity of spouse or sexual partner 

The DSM-V lists paranoid personality disorder essentially unchanged from the DSM-IV-TR version and lists associated features that describe it in a more quotidian way  These features include suspiciousness, intimacy avoidance, hostility and unusual beliefs/experiences 

Various researchers and clinicians may propose varieties and subsets or dimensions of personality related to the official diagnoses  Psychologist Theodore Millon has proposed five subtypes of paranoid personality:

Paranoid personality disorder can involve, in response to stress, very brief psychotic episodes (lasting minutes to hours)  The paranoid may also be at greater than average risk of experiencing major depressive disorder, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or alcohol and substance-related disorders  Criteria for other personality disorder diagnoses are commonly also met, such as: schizoid, schizotypal, narcissistic, avoidant, borderline and negativistic personality disorder 

Because of reduced levels of trust, there can be challenges in treating PPD  However, psychotherapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics and anti-anxiety medications can play a role when a person is receptive to intervention 

PPD occurs in about  –  of the general population  It is seen in – of psychiatric outpatients  It is more common in males 

Paranoid personality disorder is listed in DSM-V and was included in all previous versions of the DSM  One of the earliest descriptions of the paranoid personality comes from the French psychiatrist Valentin Magnan who described a "fragile personality" that showed idiosyncratic thinking, hypochondriasis, undue sensitivity, referential thinking and suspiciousness 

Closely related to this description is Emil Kraepelin's description from  of a pseudo-querulous personality who is "always on the alert to find grievance, but without delusions", vain, self-absorbed, sensitive, irritable, litigious, obstinate, and living at strife with the world  In , he renamed the condition paranoid personality and described these people as distrustful, feeling unjustly treated and feeling subjected to hostility, interference and oppression  He also observed a contradiction in these personalities: on the one hand, they stubbornly hold on to their unusual ideas, on the other hand, they often accept every piece of gossip as the truth  Kraepelin also noted that paranoid personalities were often present in people who later developed paranoid psychosis  Subsequent writers also considered traits like suspiciousness and hostility to predispose people to developing delusional illnesses, particularly "late paraphrenias" of old age 

Following Kraepelin, Eugen Bleuler described "contentious psychopathy" or "paranoid constitution" as displaying the characteristic triad of suspiciousness, grandiosity and feelings of persecution  He also emphasized that these people's false assumptions do not attain the form of real delusion 

Ernst Kretschmer emphasized the sensitive inner core of the paranoia-prone personality: they feel shy and inadequate but at the same time they have an attitude of entitlement  They attribute their failures to the machinations of others but secretly to their own inadequacy  They experience constant tension between feelings of self-importance and experiencing the environment as unappreciative and humiliating 

Karl Jaspers, a German phenomenologist, described "self-insecure" personalities who resemble the paranoid personality  According to Jaspers, such people experience inner humiliation, brought about by outside experiences and their interpretations of them  They have an urge to get external confirmation to their self-deprecation and that makes them see insults in the behavior of other people  They suffer from every slight because they seek the real reason for them in themselves  This kind of insecurity leads to overcompensation: compulsive formality, strict social observances and exaggerated displays of assurance 

In , Kurt Schneider described the "fanatic psychopaths" and divided them into two categories: the combative type that is very insistent about his false notions and actively quarrelsome, and the eccentric type that is passive, secretive, vulnerable to esoteric sects but nonetheless suspicious about others 

The descriptions of Leonhard and Sheperd from the sixties describe paranoid people as overvaluing their abilities and attributing their failure to the ill-will of others; they also mention that their interpersonal relations are disturbed and they are in constant conflict with others 

In , Polatin described the paranoid personality as rigid, suspicious, watchful, self-centered and selfish, inwardly hypersensitive but emotionally undemonstrative  However, when there is a difference of opinion, the underlying mistrust, authoritarianism and rage burst through 

In the s, paranoid personality disorder received little attention, and when it did receive it, the focus was on its potential relationship to paranoid schizophrenia  The most significant contribution of this decade comes from Theodore Millon who divided the features of paranoid personality disorder to four categories:

behavioral characteristics of vigilance, abrasive irritability and counterattack,

complaints indicating oversensitivity, social isolation and mistrust,

the dynamics of denying personal insecurities, attributing these to others and self-inflation through grandiose fantasies

coping style of detesting dependence and hostile distancing of oneself from others

Ideas of reference and delusions of reference describe the phenomenon of an individual experiencing innocuous events or mere coincidences and believing they have strong personal significance  It is "the notion that everything one perceives in the world relates to one's own destiny", usually in a negative and hostile manner 

In psychiatry, delusions of reference form part of the diagnostic criteria for psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder (during the elevated stages of mania), as well as schizotypal personality disorder,  and even autism when under periods of intense stress  To a lesser extent, it can be a hallmark of paranoid personality disorder, as well as body dysmorphic disorder  Such symptoms can also be caused by intoxication, such as stimulants like methamphetamine 

In Sigmund Freud's view, "Delusions of being watched present this power in a regressive form, thus revealing its genesis voices, as well as the undefined multitude, are brought into the foreground again by the  disease, and so the evolution of conscience is reproduced regressively " As early as , Freud's contemporary, Carl Jung, introduced the concept of synchronicity, a theory of "meaningful coincidences" 

In , Otto Fenichel concluded that "the projection of the superego is most clearly seen in ideas of reference and of being influenced Delusions of this kind merely bring to the patient from the outside what his self-observing and self-critical conscience actually tells him "

Jacques Lacan similarly saw ideas of reference as linked to "the unbalancing of the relation to the capital Other and the radical anomaly that it involves, qualified, improperly, but not without some approximation to the truth, in old clinical medicine, as partial delusion"—the "big other, that is, the other of language, the Names-of-the-Father, signifiers or words", in short, the realm of the superego 

Validation rather than clinical condemnation of ideas of reference is frequently expressed by anti-psychiatrists, on the grounds, for example, that "the patient's ideas of reference and influence and delusions of persecution were merely descriptions of her parents' behavior toward her " While accepting that "there is certainly confusion between persecutory fantasies and persecutory realities", figures like David Cooper believe that "ideas of connection with apparently remote people, or ideas of being influenced by others equally remote, are in fact stating their experience" of social influence – albeit in a distorted form by "including in their network of influence institutions as absurd as Scotland Yard, the Queen of England, the President of the United States, or the BBC" 

R  D  Laing took a similar view of the person who was "saying that his brains have been taken from him, that his actions are controlled from outer space, etc  Such delusions are partially achieved derealization-realizations " Laing also considered how "in typical paranoid ideas of reference, the person feels that the murmurings and mutterings he hears as he walks past a street crowd are about him  In a bar, a burst of laughter behind his back is at some joke cracked about him", but felt that deeper acquaintance with the patient reveals in fact that "what tortures him is not so much his delusions of reference, but his harrowing suspicion that he is of no importance to anyone, that no one is referring to him at all "

Ideas of reference must be distinguished from delusions of reference, which may be similar in content but are held with greater conviction  With the former, but not the latter, the person holding them may have "the feeling that strangers are talking about him/her, but if challenged, acknowledges that the people may be talking about something else" 

From the psychoanalytic view, there may be at the same time "transitions to delusions" from ideas of reference: "abortive ideas of reference, in the beginning of their development or, in schizotypal personalities, continuously, may remain subject to the patient's criticism under adverse circumstances, by minimal economic shifts, however, reality testing may be lost and daydreams of this kind turn into delusions "

It has been noted that a person "rigidly controlled by his superego readily forms sensitive ideas of reference  A key experience may occur in his life circumstances and quite suddenly these ideas become structured as delusions of reference " Within the "focus of paranoia that man crossing his legs, that woman wearing that blouse—it can't just be accidental  It has a particular meaning, is intended to convey something 

Persons with ideas of reference may experience:

Believing that "somehow everyone on a passing city bus is talking about them" 

Feeling that people on television or radio are either talking about them or talking directly to them 

Believing that headlines or articles in newspapers have been written exclusively for them 

Believing that events (even world events) have been deliberately contrived for them, or have special personal significance for them 

Believing that the lyrics of a song are specifically about them 

Believing that the normal function of cell phones, computers, and other electronic devices is to send secret and significant messages that only they can understand or believe 

Perceiving objects or events as having been deliberately set up to convey a particular meaning to themselves 

Thinking "that the slightest careless movement on the part of another person had great personal meaning increased significance" 

Thinking that posts on social networking websites or Internet blogs have hidden meanings pertaining to them 

Believing that the behavior of others is in reference to an abnormal, offensive body odor, which in reality is non-existent and cannot be smelled or detected by others (see: olfactory reference syndrome)

Hostile attribution bias, or hostile attribution of intent, is the tendency to interpret others' behaviors as having hostile intent, even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign  For example, a person with high levels of hostile attribution bias might see two people laughing and immediately interpret this behavior as two people laughing about them, even though the behavior was ambiguous and may have been benign 

The term "hostile attribution bias" was first coined in  by Nasby, Hayden, and DePaulo who noticed, along with several other key pioneers in this research area (e g , Kenneth A  Dodge), that a subgroup of children tend to attribute hostile intent to ambiguous social situations more often than other children  Since then, hostile attribution bias has been conceptualized as a bias of social information processing (similar to other attribution biases), including the way individuals perceive, interpret, and select responses to situations  While occasional hostile attribution bias is normative (particularly for younger children), researchers have found that individuals who exhibit consistent and high levels of hostile attribution bias across development are much more likely to engage in aggressive behavior (e g , hitting/fighting, reacting violently, verbal or relational aggression) toward others 

In addition, hostile attribution bias is hypothesized to be one important pathway through which other risk factors, such as peer rejection or harsh parenting behavior, lead to aggression  For example, children exposed to peer teasing at school or child abuse at home are much more likely to develop high levels of hostile attribution bias, which then lead them to behave aggressively at school and/or at home  Thus, in addition to partially explaining one way aggression develops, hostile attribution bias also represents a target for the intervention and prevention of aggressive behaviors 

The term hostile attribution bias first emerged in  when researchers began noticing that some children, particularly aggressive and/or rejected children, tended to interpret social situations differently compared to other children  For example, Nasby and colleagues presented photographs of people to a group of aggressive adolescent boys (aged –) and observed that a subgroup of these youth exhibited a consistent tendency to attribute hostile intent to the photographs, even when the cues were ambiguous or benign  Similarly, Kenneth A  Dodge and colleagues conducted a study on a sample of school-aged children between rd–th grade and found that children who were rejected were much more likely than other children to exhibit hostile attributions of intent to ambiguous social situations (e g , when a behavior could have been either accidental or intentional)  Furthermore, Dodge and colleagues found that children with high hostile attribution bias then went on to exhibit the most aggressive behaviors later on 

Early studies investigating links between hostile attribution bias and aggression were somewhat mixed, with some studies reporting no significant effects or small effects and other studies reporting large effects  Since then, over  studies and a meta-analysis have documented a robust association between hostile attribution bias and aggressive behavior across various samples ranging in age, gender, race, countries, and clinical populations 

Hostile attribution bias is typically conceptualized within a social information processing framework, in which social information (e g , during an interaction) is processed in a series of steps that leads to a behavioral reaction  Accurate social information processing requires a person to engage in six steps that occur in order 

Accurately encode information in the brain and store it in short-term memory  During this step, an individual will pay attention to and code specific stimuli/cues in their environment, including external factors (e g , someone bumping into you; other people's reactions to the situation) and internal factors (e g , your affective reaction to the situation) 

Accurately interpret or give meaning to encoded information  During this step, an individual may decide if a behavior or situation was meant to be hostile or benign 

Decide a goal for the interaction

Generate potential responses

Evaluate potential responses and select the "optimal" response

Enact chosen response

Hostile attribution bias is theorized to result from deviations in any of these steps, including paying attention to and encoding biased information (e g , only paying attention to cues suggestive of hostility), biases toward negative interpretations of social interactions (e g , more likely to interpret situation as hostile), limited ability to generate a broad range of potential responses, and difficulty appropriately evaluating responses and selecting an optimal response  Furthermore, biases in any of the steps affect the rest of the steps  Hostile attribution bias has been particularly linked to step  of social information processing (i e , interpretation of information), but is linked to impairments in other steps as well, including inaccurate perception/encoding of social situations and problems with generating a broad range of potential behavioral responses  For example, a child with high levels of hostile attribution bias may generate fewer potential responses than other children, and these responses may be limited to hostile or ineffective responses to a situation 

Dodge theorized that hostile attribution bias arises from an individual's hostile schemas about the world that are formed through an interaction between a child's neural dispositions and his/her early exposures to hostile socialization experiences  These experiences may include disrupted parental attachment, child abuse, exposure to family violence, peer rejection or victimization, and community violence 

In research settings, hostile attribution bias is typically measured with a laboratory task, in which participants are presented with staged interaction (live actors), video, picture, audio, or written presentations of ambiguous social situations  For example, an ambiguous social situation presented might be a video of a child opening a door, causing the door to knock over a tower of toys that another child was building  After the stimulus is presented, participants would be asked to make attributions about the intent of the actor (i e , hostile vs  benign)  (For example: "Do you think the girl who opened the door was trying to be mean, nice, or could have been mean or nice?")  Multiple trials are administered with various ambiguous scenarios, and these attributions are then used by the researchers to determine the level of the child's hostile attribution bias  Careful selection of stimuli and comparison of stimuli across mediums is helpful for accurately assessing an individual's level of hostile attribution bias  A meta-analysis investigating the link between hostile attribution bias and aggressive behavior found that the strongest effect sizes were linked with actual staging of social interactions, followed by audio presentation of stimuli, then video and picture presentation 

Substantial literature has documented a robust association between hostile attribution bias and aggression in youth  Hostile attribution bias is traditionally associated with overt physical aggression (e g , hitting, fighting), such that higher levels of hostile attribution bias predict more aggressive behavior  In particular, much evidence suggests that hostile attribution bias is especially linked to "reactive aggression" (i e , impulsive and "hot-blooded" aggression that reflects an angry retaliation to perceived provocation) rather than "proactive aggression" (i e , unprovoked, planned/instrumental, or "cold-blooded" aggression)  Beyond physical aggression, elevated hostile attribution bias is also associated with increased use of relational aggression (e g , gossip, spreading rumors, social exclusion)  This is particularly the case when youth attribute hostile intent to ambiguous relational situations (e g , not receiving an invitation to a party or not receiving a response to a text) 

Hostile attribution bias has also been documented in adult populations, and adults with high levels of hostile attribution bias are over  times more likely to die by the age of  than adults with low levels of hostile attribution bias  Hostile attribution bias is particularly linked to relational problems in adulthood, including marital conflict/violence and marital/relationship dissatisfaction  Finally, parents with high levels of hostile attribution bias are also much more likely to use harsh discipline and aggressive parenting, which may further contribute to the intergenerational continuity in hostile attribution bias and aggression across time 

Hostile attribution bias has been tested as a malleable target for intervention for aggressive behaviors in youth, including in cognitive interventions designed to increase accurate identification of others' intentions and attribution of benign intentions  Relative success has been documented from these interventions in changing levels of hostile attribution bias, although actual enduring changes in aggressive behavior have been modest

Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) or megalomania is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive craving for admiration, and struggles with empathy  People with NPD often spend much time daydreaming about achieving power and success, and perceive injustice for failing to do so  This is a pattern of obsessive thoughts and unstable sense of identity, often to cope with a sub-par real life  People with the diagnosis in recent years have spoken out about its stigma in media, and possible links to abusive situations and childhood trauma  Such narcissistic behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a broad range of situations 

The causes of narcissistic personality disorder are unknown, but theorized to be linked to certain types of traumas  The condition of NPD is included in the cluster B personality disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)  A diagnosis of NPD is made by a healthcare professional interviewing the person in question  The condition of NPD should be differentiated from mania and substance use disorder 

Treatments for narcissistic personality disorder have not been well studied  Therapy is difficult, because people with NPD usually do not consider their own issues as symptoms, despite mental distress  Additionally, people with narcissistic personality disorders have decreased life satisfaction and lower qualities of life, even when their narcissism is undiagnosed  People with NPD may have other comorbid psychiatric conditions as well, making it more difficult to identify the symptoms  About one percent of people are believed to be affected with NPD at some point in their lives  It occurs more often in men than women, and typically affects younger as opposed to older people  The narcissistic personality was first described by the psychoanalyst Robert Waelder, in   The term narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) was coined by Heinz Kohut in  

People with narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) are characterized by the personality traits of persistent grandiosity, an excessive need for admiration, and a personal disdain and lack of empathy for other people  As such, the person with NPD usually displays arrogance and a distorted sense of personal superiority, and seeks to establish abusive power and control over others  Self-confidence (a strong sense of self) is a personality trait different from the traits of NPD; thus, people with NPD typically value themselves over others, to the extent of openly disregarding the wishes and feelings of anyone else, and expect to be treated as superior, regardless of their actual status or achievements  Socially, the person with NPD usually exhibits a fragile ego (self-concept), intolerance of criticism, and a tendency to belittle other people, in order to validate their own superiority 

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-, ) indicates that a person with NPD possesses at least five of the following nine criteria, typically without possessing the commensurate personal qualities or accomplishments for which they demand respect and status:

A grandiose sense of self-importance (e g  exaggerating achievements and talents, expecting to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements)

Preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love

Believing that they are "special" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions)

Requiring excessive admiration

A sense of entitlement (unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with their expectations)

Being interpersonally exploitative (taking advantage of others to achieve their own ends)

Lacking empathy: unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others

Often being envious of others or believing that others are envious of them

Showing arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes

Narcissistic personality disorder usually develops either in youth or in early adulthood, and it is common for children and youths to display personality traits that resemble NPD, but such occurrences are usually transient, and register below the clinical criteria for a formal diagnosis of NPD  True symptoms of NPD are pervasive, apparent in varied social situations, and are rigidly consistent over time  Severe symptoms of NPD can significantly impair the person's mental capabilities to develop meaningful human relationships, such as friendship, kinship and marriage  Generally, the symptoms of NPD also impair the person's psychological abilities to function socially, either at work or at school, or within important societal settings  The DSM-V indicates that in order to qualify as symptomatic of NPD the person's manifested personality traits must substantially differ from social norms 

People with NPD exaggerate their skills, accomplishments, and their degree of intimacy with people they consider high-status  Such a sense of personal superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations, or to become impatient and disdainful when other persons talk about themselves  This attitude connects to an overall worse functioning in areas of life like work and intimate romantic relationships  When wounded in the ego, either by a real or a perceived criticism, the narcissist's displays of anger can be disproportionate to the nature of the criticism suffered; but typically, the actions and responses of the NPD person are deliberate and calculated  Despite occasional flare-ups of personal insecurity, the inflated self-concept of the NPD person is primarily stable 

To the extent that people are pathologically narcissistic, the person with NPD can be a self-absorbed control freak who passes blame by psychological projection and is intolerant of contradictory views and opinions; is apathetic towards the emotional, mental, and psychological needs of other people; and is indifferent to the negative effects of their behaviors, whilst insisting that people should see them as an ideal person  To protect their fragile self-concept, narcissists use psychosocial strategies, such as the tendency to devalue and derogate and to insult and blame other people, usually with anger and hostility towards people's responses to the narcissist's anti-social conduct  Because their fragile egos are hypersensitive to perceived criticism or defeat, people with NPD are prone to feelings of shame, humiliation, and worthlessness over minor incidents of daily life and imagined, personal slights, and usually mask such feelings from people, either by way of feigned humility, or by responding with outbursts of rage and defiance, or by seeking revenge  The merging of the inflated self-concept and the actual self is evident in the grandiosity component of narcissistic personality disorder; also inherent to that psychological process are the defense mechanisms of idealization and devaluation and of denial 

The DSM-V indicates that: "Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered narcissistic  Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting, and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress, do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder " Given the high-function sociability associated with narcissism, some people with NPD might not view such a diagnosis as a functional impairment to their lives  Although overconfidence tends to make people with NPD very ambitious, such a mindset does not necessarily lead to professional high achievement and success, because they refuse to take risks, in order to avoid failure or the appearance of failure  Moreover, the psychological inability to tolerate disagreement, contradiction, and criticism, make it difficult for persons with NPD to work cooperatively or to maintain long-term, professional relationships with superiors and colleagues 

The occurrence of narcissistic personality disorder presents a high rate of comorbidity with other mental disorders  People with NPD are prone to bouts of psychological depression, often to the degree that meets the clinical criteria for a co-occurring depressive disorder  Moreover, the occurrence of NPD is further associated with the occurrence of bipolar disorder and substance use disorders, especially cocaine use disorder  In that vein, NPD also might be comorbid with the occurrence of other mental disorders, such as histrionic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, or paranoid personality disorder 

The causes of narcissistic personality disorder are unknown  Researchers apply a biopsychosocial model of causation, whereby the occurrence and the expression of NPD – a pathological amplification of the traits of the narcissistic personality – are consequent to a combination of nature and nurture, of environmental and social, genetic and neurobiological factors 

Narcissistic personality disorder is an inheritable psychological condition; research evidence indicates that a person is more likely to develop NPD if said personality disorder occurs in the medical history of his or her family  The results reported in A Twin Study of Personality Disorders  indicate that the rate of occurrence of personality disorders in twins determined that there is a moderate-to-high likelihood of the heritability of NPD; and the research of The Genetic Epidemiology of Personality Disorders  indicates that specific genes and genetic interactions (epistasis) contribute to the formation of NPD, and to the development of a narcissistic personality, yet how genetics influences the developmental and the physiologic processes underlying NPD remains undetermined 

Malfunctioning inner brain - hippocampus, amygdala

Research shows a malfunctioning inner brain: the hippocampus up to  smaller, a smaller amygdala, malfunctions in the striatum-nucleus accumbens and the cingulum neural pathways connecting them and taking care of the feedback loops on what to do with all the incoming information from the multiple senses; so what comes out is anti-social 

Environmental and social factors also exert significant influence upon the onset of NPD in a person  In some people, pathological narcissism may develop from an impaired emotional attachment to the primary caregivers, usually the parents  That lack of psychological and emotional attachment to a parental figure can result in the child's perception of themselves as unimportant and unconnected to other people, usually family, community and society  Typically, the child comes to believe that they have a personality defect that makes them an unvalued and unwanted person; in that vein, either overindulgent and permissive parenting or insensitive and over-controlling parenting are contributing factors towards the development of NPD in a child 

In Gabbard's Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders , the following factors are identified as promoting the development of narcissistic personality disorder:

An oversensitive temperament (individual differences of behavior) at birth

Excessive admiration that is never balanced with realistic criticism

Excessive praise for good behaviors, or excessive criticism for bad behaviors in childhood

Overindulgence and overvaluation by family or peers

Being praised by adults for perceived exceptional physical appearance or abilities

Trauma caused by psychological abuse, physical abuse or sexual abuse in childhood

Unpredictable or unreliable parental caregiving

Learning the behaviors of psychological manipulation from parents or peers

Moreover, the research reported in "Modernity and Narcissistic Personality Disorders"  indicates that cultural elements also influence the prevalence of NPD, because narcissistic personality traits more commonly occur in modern societies than in traditionalist conservative societies 

Studies of the occurrence of narcissistic personality disorder, such as Gray Matter Abnormalities in Patients with Narcissistic Personality Disorder  and Narcissists' Lack of Empathy Tied to Less Gray Matter  identified structural abnormalities in the brains of people afflicted with NPD, specifically, a lesser volume of gray matter in the left, anterior insular cortex  The results of the study Brain Structure in Narcissistic Personality Disorder: A VBM and DTI Pilot Study  associated the condition of NPD with a reduced volume of gray matter in the prefrontal cortex  The regions of the brain identified and studied – the insular cortex and the prefrontal cortex – are associated with the human emotions of empathy and compassion, and with the mental functions of cognition and emotional regulation  The neurologic findings of the studies suggest that NPD may be related to a compromised (damaged) capacity for emotional empathy and emotional regulation 

The American Psychiatric Association's (APA) formulation, description, and definition of narcissistic personality disorder, as published in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Ed , Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR, ), was criticised by clinicians as inadequately describing the range and complexity of the personality disorder that is NPD  That it is excessively focused upon "the narcissistic individual's external, symptomatic, or social interpersonal patterns – at the expense of   internal complexity and individual suffering", which reduced the clinical utility of the NPD definition in the DSM-IV-TR 

In revising the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders, the work group for the list of "Personality and Personality Disorders" proposed the elimination of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) as a distinct entry in the DSM-, and thus replaced a categorical approach to NPD with a dimensional approach, which is based upon the severity of the dysfunctional-personality-trait domains  Clinicians critical of the DSM-V revision characterized the new diagnostic system as an "unwieldy conglomeration of disparate models that cannot happily coexist", which is of limited usefulness in clinical practice  Despite the reintroduction of the NPD entry, the APA's re-formulation, re-description, and re-definition of NPD, towards a dimensional view based upon personality traits, remains in the list of personality disorders of the DSM- 

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, th Edition (ICD-), of the World Health Organization (WHO), lists narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) under the category of "Other specific personality disorders"  The ICD-X requires that any personality-disorder diagnosis also meet and satisfy the General diagnostic criteria  used for determining that a person has a diagnosable personality disorder 

Although the DSM-V indicates narcissistic personality disorder as a homogeneous syndrome, there is evidence of overt and covert subtypes in the expression of NPD  The study Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic and Clinical Challenges  indicates the existence of two subtypes of narcissism: (i) Grandiose narcissism, characterized by the personality traits of grandiosity, arrogance, and boldness; and (ii) Vulnerable narcissism, characterized by the personality traits of defensiveness and hypersensitivity  The research indicates that people with grandiose narcissism express behavior "through interpersonally exploitative acts, lack of empathy, intense envy, aggression, and exhibitionism "

In an inventory of the types of NPD, the psychiatrist Glen Gabbard described the "oblivious" subtype of narcissist as being a grandiose, arrogant, and thick-skinned person; and described the "narcissistic vulnerability" of the subtype of person who consciously exhibits the personality traits of helplessness and emotional emptiness, and of low self-esteem and shame, which usually are expressed as socially avoidant behavior in situations where the narcissist's self-presentation is impossible; therefore, they withdraw from situations wherein the needed or expected social approval is not given  Gabbard also described the "hypervigilant" subtype of narcissist whose feelings are easily hurt, has an oversensitive temperament, and ashamed; and described the "high-functioning" subtype of narcissist as a person less functionally impaired in the areas of life where narcissists with a severe expression of NPD usually have difficulties in functioning as a normally-socialized person 

In the study Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV-TM and Beyond , Theodore Millon suggested five subtypes of narcissist; however, there are few, pure subtypes of narcissist  Moreover, Millon's five subtypes of narcissist are not recognized in either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 

Narcissistic personality disorder is rarely the primary reason for which people seek mental health treatment  When people with NPD enter treatment (psychologic or psychiatric), they usually are prompted by difficulties in their lives, or are seeking relief from some other disorder of their mental health, such as a major depressive disorder, a substance use disorder (drug addiction), or bipolar disorder  The reason for such an indirect path to psychotherapeutic treatment is partly because narcissists generally possess poor insight, and are unaware that their actions produced their mentally unhealthy circumstance, and so fail to recognize that their perceptions and behaviors are socially inappropriate and problematic, because of their very positive self-image (inflated self-concept) 

In general, psychotherapy is the basis for treating narcissistic personality disorder  In the s, Heinz Kohut and Otto Kernberg challenged the conventional wisdom of the time with clinical strategies that applied psychoanalytic therapy to NPD clients, which, they claimed, effectively treated that personality disorder  Contemporary psychotherapy treatments include transference-focused therapy; metacognitive therapy; and schema therapy, to treat the client's particular subtype of NPD  Improvements to the mental health of patients with NPD are possible with psychopharmaceutical treatment of the symptoms of the comorbid disorders; despite such drug therapy, the psychologist Elsa Ronningstam said that "alliance-building and engaging the patient's sense of agency and reflective ability are essential for  change in pathological narcissism " Psychiatric medications usually are not indicated for treating NPD, but can be used to treat the co-occurring symptoms of psychological depression, anxiety, and impulsiveness, when present in the NPD client  In the field of relationship counseling mental health therapy is most beneficial when both partners participate in the treatments 

The effectiveness of psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions in the treatment of narcissistic personality disorder has yet to be systematically and empirically investigated  Clinical practice guidelines for the disorder have not yet been created, and current treatment recommendations are largely based on theoretical psychodynamic models of NPD and the experiences of clinicians with afflicted individuals in clinical settings 

The presence of NPD in patients undergoing psychotherapy for the treatment of other mental disorders is associated with slower treatment progress and higher dropout rates 

The lifetime rates of narcissistic personality disorder are estimated at  in the general population; and between  and  in the clinical population  A  review found rates of NPD of up to  in community samples, and that the yearly number of new cases of NPD in men is slightly greater than in women  A  review found that the rates of NPD have been relatively stable for men and women throughout the thirty-year period in which data were collected 

The historical use of the term narcissism, to describe a person's excessive vanity and self-centeredness, predates the modern medical classification of NPD (narcissistic personality disorder)  The mental condition of narcissism is named after the mythological character Narcissus, a beautiful boy, born of a nymph, who became infatuated with his own reflection in a pool of water  At first, Narcissus did not understand that the image he saw in the pool of water was a reflection of himself; when he did understand that fact, he pined for the unattainable image and died of grief, for having fallen in love with someone who did not exist outside of himself 

Further conceptual developments and refinements of the mental condition of Narcissism produced the term narcissistic personality structure, which was introduced by Otto Friedmann Kernberg, in ; and the term narcissistic personality disorder, which was proposed by Heinz Kohut, in  

Regarding the adult neurotic's sense of omnipotence, Sigmund Freud said that "this belief is a frank acknowledgement of a relic of the old megalomania of infancy"; and concluded that: "we can detect an element of megalomania in most other forms of paranoic disorder  We are justified in assuming that this megalomania is essentially of an infantile nature, and that, as development proceeds, it is sacrificed to social considerations "

In The Psychology of Gambling , Edmund Bergler considered megalomania to be a normal occurrence in the psychology of a child, a condition later reactivated in adult life, if the individual takes up the vice of gambling  In The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis , Otto Fenichel said that people who, in their later lives, respond with denial to their own narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury, usually undergo a similar regression to the megalomania of childhood 

In the second half of the th century, in contrast to Freud's perspective that megalomania is an obstacle to psychoanalysis, in the US and UK, Kleinian psychologists used the object relations theory to re-evaluate megalomania as a defence mechanism, a circumstance that offered the psychotherapist access to the patient for treatment  Such a Kleinian therapeutic approach built upon Heinz Kohut's view of narcissistic megalomania as an aspect of normal mental development, by contrast with Otto Kernberg's consideration of such grandiosity as a pathological distortion of normal psychological development 

Megalomania is a mental state in which the affected individual is subject to an obsession with power and the belittling of others, as well as feelings of grandiosity  Its characteristics are similar to that of grandiose narcissism, with the exception of a few variations  Megalomania was not mentioned in the DSM-V as an independent disorder, instead being forged with Narcissistic Personality Disorder 

Those with megalomania often show symptoms such as: condescension, overestimation of one's abilities, feelings of uniqueness, inflated self-esteem, and have a drive to maintain control over others  In addition to this, megalomaniacs have dreams of power, success and wealth  Overall, megalomania involves intense feelings of grandiosity  Those with this condition are believed to have internal feelings of inferiority, which they attempt to suppress by seeking admiration from others  It shares many similarities to narcissism, though there are a few differences  Perhaps most noteworthy of all, megalomaniacs are generally more concerned with superiority, while narcissists are more associated with feelings of excessive self-worth  Megalomania does not share narcissistic traits such as a sense of entitlement, attention-seeking behavior, desire for admiration or intolerance towards criticism  While narcissists are preoccupied with attempting to belittle others, megalomaniacs believe they have already dominated others, and need to maintain the domination  Also, megalomaniacs are highly conceited, while narcissists, particularly the vulnerable type, can often have low levels of self-esteem and self-confidence 

While the causes of megalomania are relatively unknown and variable, those who develop the condition are believed to have come from a place of insecurity 

The term megalomania first came into usage in the late s and began to be used popularly by the public in the early s  A former mental disorder, Megalomania has since been removed from the DSM, and forged in with narcissistic personality disorder 

In popular culture, narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is also known as megalomania  Some writers discuss 'narcissistic abuse' as a unique form of abuse, although the concept is not formally recognized in health care  Other scholars suggest there is little evidence to show psychological, financial, sexual or physical abuse manifests itself differently or more often in people with narcissistic traits or narcissistic personality disorder 

The Norwegian study, Validity Aspects of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Narcissistic Personality Disorder Construct  concluded that narcissism should be conceived as personality dimensions pertinent to the full range of personality disorders, rather than as a distinct diagnostic category  In the study Debates on the Narcissism Conundrum: Trait, Domain, Dimension, Type, or Disorder?  examining the past literature about NPD, the researchers Renato Alarcón and Silvana Sarabia concluded that narcissistic personality disorder "shows nosological inconsistency, and that its consideration as a trait domain needed further research would be strongly beneficial to the field "

Narcissistic rage is a psychological construct that describes a reaction to narcissistic injury, which is conceptualized as a perceived threat to a narcissist's self-esteem or self-worth  Narcissistic injury (or narcissistic scar) is a phrase used by Sigmund Freud in the s; narcissistic wound and narcissistic blow are further, almost interchangeable terms  The term narcissistic rage was coined by Heinz Kohut in  

The model underlying the construct suggests that narcissistic injury occurs when a narcissist's elevated self-image or perception is threatened and feels that their hidden, "true self" has been revealed  This may be the case when the narcissist experiences a "fall from grace", such as when their hidden behaviors or motivations are revealed, or when their egotism is challenged or questioned  Narcissistic injury is a cause of distress and can lead to dysregulation of behaviors as in narcissistic rage 

Narcissistic rage occurs on a continuum, which may range from instances of aloofness and expressions of mild irritation or annoyance to serious outbursts, including violent attacks and murder  Narcissistic rage reactions are not limited to personality disorders and may be also seen in catatonic, paranoid delusion and depressive episodes  It has also been suggested that narcissists have two layers of rage  The first layer of rage can be thought of as a constant anger (towards someone else), with the second layer being a self-aimed wrath 

In his  case study of the "Wolfman", Freud identified the cause of the subject's adult neurosis as the moment when "he was forced to realise that his gonorrheal infection constituted a serious injury to his body  The blow to his narcissism was too much for him and he went to pieces"  A few years later, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, looking at the inevitable setbacks of childhood sexuality, Freud maintained that "loss of love and failure leave behind them a permanent injury to self-regard in the form of a narcissistic scar   reflecting the full extent to which he has been 'scorned'" 

Freud's concept of what in his last book he called "early injuries to the self (injuries to narcissism)" was subsequently extended by a wide variety of psychoanalysts  Karl Abraham saw the key to adult depressions in the childhood experience of a blow to narcissism through the loss of narcissistic supply  Otto Fenichel confirmed the importance of narcissistic injury in depressives and expanded such analyses to include borderline personalities 

Edmund Bergler emphasized the importance of infantile omnipotence in narcissism, and the rage that follows any blow to that sense of narcissistic omnipotence; Annie Reich stressed how a feeling of shame-fuelled rage, when a blow to narcissism exposed the gap between one's ego ideal and mundane reality; while Lacanians linked Freud on the narcissistic wound to Lacan on the narcissistic mirror stage 

Finally, object relations theory highlights rage against early environmental failures that left patients feeling bad about themselves when childhood omnipotence was too abruptly challenged 

Rape trauma syndrome among women often results in intense narcissistic rage, which the rape victim may direct at herself or at others experienced as unsuccessful self-objects  As the victimology scholar Elaine Hilberman writes, the rape survivor "experiences not only overwhelming fear for her very existence, but an equally overwhelming sense of helplessness which few other events in one's life can parallel"  Elaborating on this point, the psychoanalysts Richard B  Ulman and Doris Brothers write in The Shattered Self : "Because archaic narcissistic fantasies so often entail illusions of omnipotent invincibility and impenetrability as well as union with all-mighty beings, rape, as Hilberman describes it, is likely to destroy such illusions  It stands to reason that the more the event lends itself to an experience of terror and helplessness, the greater the likelihood of its being imbued with traumatic meaning, even if a woman' archaic narcissistic fantasies have successfully undergone developmental transformation  Conversely, a rape that does not have such shattering import might not be experienced as traumatic, even if a woman's narcissistic fantasies are highly archaic and untransformed "

Heinz Kohut explored a wide range of rage experiences in his seminal article "Thoughts on Narcissism and Narcissistic Rage"   He considered narcissistic rage as one major form among many, contrasting it especially with mature aggression  Because the very structure of the self itself is weakened in the narcissist, their rage cannot flower into real assertiveness; and they are left instead prone to oversensitivity to perceived or imagined narcissistic injuries resulting in narcissistic rage 

For Kohut, narcissistic rage is related to narcissists' need for total control of their environment, including "the need for revenge, for righting a wrong, for undoing a hurt by whatever means"  It is an attempt by the narcissist to turn from a passive sense of victimization to an active role in giving pain to others, while at the same time attempting to rebuild their own (actually false) sense of self-worth  It may also involve self-protection and preservation, with rage serving to restore a sense of safety and power by destroying that which had threatened the narcissist 

Alternatively, according to Kohut, rages can be seen as a result of the shame at being faced with failure  Narcissistic rage is the uncontrollable and unexpected anger that results from a narcissistic injury – a threat to a narcissist's self-esteem or worth  Rage comes in many forms, but all pertain to the same important thing: revenge  Narcissistic rages are based on fear and will endure even after the threat is gone 

To the narcissist, the rage is directed towards the person that they feel has slighted them; to other people, the rage is incoherent and unjust  This rage impairs their cognition, therefore impairing their judgment  During the rage they are prone to shouting, fact distortion and making groundless accusations  In his book The Analysis of the Self, Kohut explains that expressions caused by a sense of things not going the expected way blossom into rages, and narcissists may even search for conflict to find a way to alleviate their pain or suffering  He also noted how psychoanalytic treatment might itself be experienced by a patient as an unbearable narcissistic injury 

Narcissists are often pseudo-perfectionists and create situations in which they are the center of attention  The narcissist's attempts at being seen as perfect are necessary for their grandiose self-image  If a perceived state of perfection is not reached, it can lead to guilt, shame, anger or anxiety because the subject believes that they will lose the admiration and love of other people if they are imperfect 

Behind such perfectionism, self psychology would see earlier traumatic injuries to the grandiose self 

Adam Phillips has argued that, contrary to what common sense might expect, therapeutic cure involves the patient being encouraged to re-experience "a terrible narcissistic wound" – the child's experience of exclusion by the parental alliance – in order to come to terms with, and learn again, the diminishing loss of omnipotence entailed by the basic "facts of life" 

Wide dissemination of Kohut's concepts may at times have led to their trivialization  Neville Symington points out that "You will often hear people say, 'Oh, I'm very narcissistic,' or, 'It was a wound to my narcissism ' Such comments are not a true recognition of the condition; they are throw-away lines  Really to recognise narcissism in oneself is profoundly distressing and often associated with denial "

Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or infrequently APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others  A weak or nonexistent conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of legal problems or impulsive and aggressive behaviour 

Antisocial personality disorder is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), while the equivalent concept of dissocial personality disorder (DPD) is defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD); the primary theoretical distinction between the two is that antisocial personality disorder focuses on observable behaviours, while dissocial personality disorder focuses on affective deficits  Otherwise, both manuals provide similar criteria for diagnosing the disorder  Both have also stated that their diagnoses have been referred to, or include what is referred to, as psychopathy or sociopathy  However, some researchers have drawn distinctions between the concepts of antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy, with many researchers arguing that psychopathy is a disorder that overlaps with but is distinguishable from ASPD 

Antisocial personality disorder is defined by a pervasive and persistent disregard for morals, social norms, and the rights and feelings of others  Individuals with this personality disorder will typically have no compunction in exploiting others in harmful ways for their own gain or pleasure and frequently manipulate and deceive other people  While some do so through a facade of superficial charm, others do so through intimidation and violence  They may display arrogance, think lowly and negatively of others, and lack remorse for their harmful actions and have a callous attitude to those they have harmed  Irresponsibility is a core characteristic of this disorder; most have significant difficulties in maintaining stable employment as well as fulfilling their social and financial obligations, and people with this disorder often lead exploitative, unlawful, or parasitic lifestyles 

Those with antisocial personality disorder are often impulsive and reckless, failing to consider or disregarding the consequences of their actions  They may repeatedly disregard and jeopardize their own safety and the safety of others, which can place both themselves and other people in danger  They are often aggressive and hostile, with poorly regulated tempers, and can lash out violently with provocation or frustration  Individuals are prone to substance use disorders and addiction, and the non-medical use of various psychoactive substances is common in this population  These behaviors lead such individuals into frequent conflict with the law, and many people with ASPD have extensive histories of antisocial behavior and criminal infractions stemming back to adolescence or childhood 

Serious problems with interpersonal relationships are often seen in those with the disorder  People with antisocial personality disorder usually form poor attachments and emotional bonds, and interpersonal relationships often revolve around the exploitation and abuse of others  They may have difficulties in sustaining and maintaining relationships, and some have difficulty entering them 

While antisocial personality disorder is a mental disorder diagnosed in adulthood, it has its precedent in childhood  The DSM-'s criteria for ASPD require that the individual have conduct problems evident by the age of   Persistent antisocial behavior, as well as a lack of regard for others in childhood and adolescence, is known as conduct disorder and is the precursor of ASPD  About – of youths with conduct disorder will be diagnosed with ASPD in adulthood 

Conduct disorder (CD) is a disorder diagnosed in childhood that parallels the characteristics found in ASPD and is characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate norms are violated  Children with the disorder often display impulsive and aggressive behavior, may be callous and deceitful, and may repeatedly engage in petty crime such as stealing or vandalism or get into fights with other children and adults  This behavior is typically persistent and may be difficult to deter with threat or punishment  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common in this population, and children with the disorder may also engage in substance use  CD is differentiated from oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in that children with ODD do not commit aggressive or antisocial acts against other people, animals, and property, though many children diagnosed with ODD are subsequently rediagnosed with CD 

Two developmental courses for CD have been identified based on the age at which the symptoms become present  The first is known as the "childhood-onset type" and occurs when conduct disorder symptoms are present before the age of  years  This course is often linked to a more persistent life course and more pervasive behaviors, and children in this group express greater levels of ADHD symptoms, neuropsychological deficits, more academic problems, increased family dysfunction, and higher likelihood of aggression and violence  The second is known as the "adolescent-onset type" and occurs when conduct disorder develops after the age of  years  Compared to the childhood-onset type, less impairment in various cognitive and emotional functions are present, and the adolescent-onset variety may remit by adulthood  In addition to this differentiation, the DSM-V provides a specifier for a callous and unemotional interpersonal style, which reflects characteristics seen in psychopathy and are believed to be a childhood precursor to this disorder  Compared to the adolescent-onset subtype, the childhood-onset subtype, especially if callous and unemotional traits are present, tends to have a worse treatment outcome 

When combined with alcoholism, people may show frontal function deficits on neuropsychological tests greater than those associated with each condition  Alcohol Use Disorder is likely caused by lack of impulse and behavioral control exhibited by Antisocial Personality Disorder patients  The rates of ASPD tends to be around - in male alcohol and opiate addicts  However, it is important to remember this is not a causal relationship, but rather a plausible consequence of cognitive deficits as a result of ASPD 

Personality disorders are seen to be caused by a combination and interaction of genetic and environmental influences  Genetically, it is the intrinsic temperamental tendencies as determined by their genetically influenced physiology, and environmentally, it is the social and cultural experiences of a person in childhood and adolescence encompassing their family dynamics, peer influences, and social values  People with an antisocial or alcoholic parent are considered to be at higher risk  Fire-setting and cruelty to animals during childhood are also linked to the development of antisocial personality  The condition is more common in males than in females, and among people who are in prison 

Research into genetic associations in antisocial personality disorder suggests that ASPD has some or even a strong genetic basis  Prevalence of ASPD is higher in people related to someone afflicted by the disorder  Twin studies, which are designed to discern between genetic and environmental effects, have reported significant genetic influences on antisocial behavior and conduct disorder 

In the specific genes that may be involved, one gene that has seen particular interest in its correlation with antisocial behavior is the gene that encodes for Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), an enzyme that breaks down monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norephinephrine  Various studies examining the genes' relationship to behavior have suggested that variants of the gene that results in less MAO-A being produced, such as the R and R alleles of the promoter region, have associations with aggressive behavior in men  The association is also influenced by negative experience in early life, with children possessing a low-activity variant (MAOA-L) who experience such maltreatment being more likely to develop antisocial behavior than those with the high-activity variant (MAOA-H)  Even when environmental interactions (e g  emotional abuse) are controlled for, a small association between MAOA-L and aggressive and antisocial behavior remains 

The gene that encodes for the serotonin transporter (SCLA), a gene that is heavily researched for its associations with other mental disorders, is another gene of interest in antisocial behavior and personality traits  Genetic associations studies have suggested that the short "S" allele is associated with impulsive antisocial behavior and ASPD in the inmate population  However, research into psychopathy find that the long "L" allele is associated with the Factor  traits of psychopathy, which describes its core affective (e g  lack of empathy, fearlessness) and interpersonal (e g  grandiosity, manipulativeness) personality disturbances  This is suggestive of two different forms, one associated more with impulsive behavior and emotional dysregulation, and the other with predatory aggression and affective disturbance, of the disorder 

Various other gene candidates for ASPD have been identified by a genome-wide association study published in   Several of these gene candidates are shared with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, with which ASPD is comorbid  Furthermore, the study found that those who carry  mutations on chromosome  are   times more likely to develop antisocial personality disorder than those who do not 

Traumatic events can lead to a disruption of the standard development of the central nervous system, which can generate a release of hormones that can change normal patterns of development  Aggressiveness and impulsivity are among the possible symptoms of ASPD  Testosterone is a hormone that plays an important role in aggressiveness in the brain  For instance, criminals who have committed violent crimes tend to have higher levels of testosterone than the average person  The effect of testosterone is counteracted by cortisol which facilitates the cognitive control of impulsive tendencies 

One of the neurotransmitters that has been discussed in individuals with ASPD is serotonin, also known as HT  A meta-analysis of  studies found significantly lower -HIAA levels (indicating lower serotonin levels), especially in those who are younger than  years of age 

While it has been shown that lower levels of serotonin may be associated with ASPD, there has also been evidence that decreased serotonin function is highly correlated with impulsiveness and aggression across a number of different experimental paradigms  Impulsivity is not only linked with irregularities in HT metabolism, but may be the most essential psychopathological aspect linked with such dysfunction  Correspondingly, the DSM-V classifies "impulsivity or failure to plan ahead" and "irritability and aggressiveness" as two of seven sub-criteria in category A of the diagnostic criteria of ASPD 

Some studies have found a relationship between monoamine oxidase A and antisocial behavior, including conduct disorder and symptoms of adult ASPD, in maltreated children 

Antisocial behavior may be related to head trauma  Antisocial behavior is associated with decreased grey matter in the right lentiform nucleus, left insula, and frontopolar cortex  Increased volumes have been observed in the right fusiform gyrus, inferior parietal cortex, right cingulate gyrus, and post central cortex 

Intellectual and cognitive ability is consistently found to be impaired or reduced in the ASPD population  Contrary to stereotypes in popular culture of the "psychopathic genius", antisocial personality disorder is associated with both reduced overall intelligence and specific reductions in individual aspects of cognitive ability  These deficits also occur in general-population samples of people with antisocial traits and in children with the precursors to antisocial personality disorder 

People that exhibit antisocial behavior demonstrate decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex  The association is more apparent in functional neuroimaging as opposed to structural neuroimaging  The prefrontal cortex is involved in many executive functions, including behavior inhibitions, planning ahead, determining consequences of action, and differentiating between right and wrong  However, some investigators have questioned whether the reduced volume in prefrontal regions is associated with antisocial personality disorder, or whether they result from co-morbid disorders, such as substance use disorder or childhood maltreatment  Moreover, it remains an open question whether the relationship is causal, i e , whether the anatomical abnormality causes the psychological and behavioral abnormality, or vice versa 

Cavum septi pellucidi (CSP) is a marker for limbic neural maldevelopment, and its presence has been loosely associated with certain mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder  One study found that those with CSP had significantly higher levels of antisocial personality, psychopathy, arrests and convictions compared with controls 

Many studies suggest that the social and home environment has contributed to the development of antisocial behavior  The parents of these children have been shown to display antisocial behavior, which could be adopted by their children  A lack of parental stimulation and affection during early development leads to high levels of cortisol with the absence of balancing hormones such as oxytocin which disrupts and overloads the child's stress response systems, which is thought to lead to underdevelopment of the child's brain that deals with emotion, empathy and ability to connect to other humans on an emotional level  According to Dr  Bruce Perry in his book The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog, "the [infant's developing] brain needs patterned, repetitive stimuli to develop properly  Spastic, unpredictable relief from fear, loneliness, discomfort, and hunger keeps a baby's stress system on high alert  An environment of intermittent care punctuated by total abandonment may be the worst of all worlds for a child "

The sociocultural perspective of clinical psychology views disorders as influenced by cultural aspects; since cultural norms differ significantly, mental disorders such as ASPD are viewed differently  Robert D  Hare has suggested that the rise in ASPD that has been reported in the United States may be linked to changes in cultural mores, the latter serving to validate the behavioral tendencies of many individuals with ASPD : While the rise reported may be in part merely a byproduct of the widening use (and abuse) of diagnostic techniques, given Eric Berne's division between individuals with active and latent ASPD – the latter keeping themselves in check by attachment to an external source of control like the law, traditional standards, or religion – it has been suggested that the erosion of collective standards may indeed serve to release the individual with latent ASPD from their previously prosocial behavior :–

There is also a continuous debate as to the extent to which the legal system should be involved in the identification and admittance of patients with preliminary symptoms of ASPD  Controversial clinical psychiatrist Pierre-Édouard Carbonneau suggested that the problem with legal forced admittance is the rate of failure when diagnosing ASPD  He states that the possibility of diagnosing and coercing a patient into prescribing medication to someone without ASPD, but is diagnosed with it could be potentially disastrous, but the possibility of not diagnosing it and seeing a patient go untreated because of a lack of sufficient evidence of cultural or environmental influences is something a psychiatrist must ignore, and in his words, "play it safe" 

The WHO's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth edition (ICD-), has a diagnosis called dissocial personality disorder (F ):

It is characterized by at least  of the following:

Callous unconcern for the feelings of others;

Gross and persistent attitude of irresponsibility and disregard for social norms, rules, and obligations;

Incapacity to maintain enduring relationships, though having no difficulty in establishing them;

Very low tolerance to frustration and a low threshold for discharge of aggression, including violence;

Incapacity to experience guilt or to profit from experience, particularly punishment;

Marked readiness to blame others or to offer plausible rationalizations for the behavior that has brought the person into conflict with society 

The ICD-X states that this diagnosis includes "amoral, antisocial, asocial, psychopathic, and sociopathic personality"  Although the disorder is not synonymous with conduct disorder, presence of conduct disorder during childhood or adolescence may further support the diagnosis of dissocial personality disorder  There may also be persistent irritability as an associated feature 

It is a requirement of the ICD-X that a diagnosis of any specific personality disorder also satisfies a set of general personality disorder criteria 

Psychopathy is commonly defined as a personality disorder characterized partly by antisocial behavior, a diminished capacity for empathy and remorse, and poor behavioral controls  Psychopathic traits are assessed using various measurement tools, including Canadian researcher Robert D  Hare's Psychopathy Checklist, Revised (PCL-R)  "Psychopathy" is not the official title of any diagnosis in the DSM-V or ICD; nor is it an official title used by other major psychiatric organizations  The DSM-V and ICD, however, state that their antisocial diagnoses are at times referred to (or include what is referred to) as psychopathy or sociopathy 

American psychiatrist Hervey Cleckley's work on psychopathy formed the basis of the diagnostic criteria for ASPD, and the DSM-V states ASPD is often referred to as psychopathy  However, critics argue ASPD is not synonymous with psychopathy as the diagnostic criteria are not the same, since criteria relating to personality traits are emphasized relatively less in the former  These differences exist in part because it was believed such traits were difficult to measure reliably and it was "easier to agree on the behaviors that typify a disorder than on the reasons why they occur" 

Although the diagnosis of ASPD covers two to three times as many prisoners than the diagnosis of psychopathy, Robert Hare believes the PCL-R is better able to predict future criminality, violence, and recidivism than a diagnosis of ASPD  He suggests there are differences between PCL-R-diagnosed psychopaths and non-psychopaths on "processing and use of linguistic and emotional information", while such differences are potentially smaller between those diagnosed with ASPD and without  Additionally, Hare argued confusion regarding how to diagnose ASPD, confusion regarding the difference between ASPD and psychopathy, as well as the differing future prognoses regarding recidivism and treatability, may have serious consequences in settings such as court cases where psychopathy is often seen as aggravating the crime 

Nonetheless, psychopathy has been proposed as a specifier under an alternative model for ASPD  In the DSM-, under "Alternative DSM-V Model for Personality Disorders", ASPD with psychopathic features is described as characterized by "a lack of anxiety or fear and by a bold interpersonal style that may mask maladaptive behaviors (e g , fraudulence) " Low levels of withdrawal and high levels of attention-seeking combined with low anxiety are associated with "social potency" and "stress immunity" in psychopathy : Under the specifier, affective and interpersonal characteristics are comparatively emphasized over behavioral components 

Theodore Millon suggested  subtypes of ASPD  However, these constructs are not recognized in the DSM-V and ICD 

Elsewhere, Millon differentiates ten subtypes (partially overlapping with the above) – covetous, risk-taking, malevolent, tyrannical, malignant, disingenuous, explosive, and abrasive – but specifically stresses that "the number  is by no means special   Taxonomies may be put forward at levels that are more coarse or more fine-grained ":

ASPD is considered to be among the most difficult personality disorders to treat  Rendering an effective treatment for ASPD is further complicated due to the inability to look at comparative studies between psychopathy and ASPD due to differing diagnostic criteria, differences in defining and measuring outcomes and a focus on treating incarcerated patients rather than those in the community  Because of their very low or absent capacity for remorse, individuals with ASPD often lack sufficient motivation and fail to see the costs associated with antisocial acts  They may only simulate remorse rather than truly commit to change: they can be seductively charming and dishonest, and may manipulate staff and fellow patients during treatment  Studies have shown that outpatient therapy is not likely to be successful, but the extent to which persons with ASPD are entirely unresponsive to treatment may have been exaggerated 

Most treatment done is for those in the criminal justice system to whom the treatment regimes are given as part of their imprisonment  Those with ASPD may stay in treatment only as required by an external source, such as parole conditions  Residential programs that provide a carefully controlled environment of structure and supervision along with peer confrontation have been recommended  There has been some research on the treatment of ASPD that indicated positive results for therapeutic interventions  Psychotherapy also known as talk therapy is found to help treat patients with ASPD Schema therapy is also being investigated as a treatment for ASPD  A review by Charles M  Borduin features the strong influence of Multisystemic therapy (MST) that could potentially improve this imperative issue  However, this treatment requires complete cooperation and participation of all family members  Some studies have found that the presence of ASPD does not significantly interfere with treatment for other disorders, such as substance use, although others have reported contradictory findings 

Therapists working with individuals with ASPD may have considerable negative feelings toward patients with extensive histories of aggressive, exploitative, and abusive behaviors  Rather than attempt to develop a sense of conscience in these individuals, which is extremely difficult considering the nature of the disorder, therapeutic techniques are focused on rational and utilitarian arguments against repeating past mistakes  These approaches would focus on the tangible, material value of prosocial behavior and abstaining from antisocial behavior  However, the impulsive and aggressive nature of those with this disorder may limit the effectiveness of even this form of therapy 

The use of medications in treating antisocial personality disorder is still poorly explored, and no medications have been approved by the FDA to specifically treat ASPD  A  Cochrane review of studies that explored the use of pharmaceuticals in ASPD patients, of which  studies met the selection criteria for review, concluded that the current body of evidence was inconclusive for recommendations concerning the use of pharmaceuticals in treating the various issues of ASPD  Nonetheless, psychiatric medications such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, and mood stabilizers can be used to control symptoms such as aggression and impulsivity, as well as treat disorders that may co-occur with ASPD for which medications are indicated 

According to Professor Emily Simonoff of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience there are many variables that are consistently connected to ASPD, such as: childhood hyperactivity and conduct disorder, criminality in adulthood, lower IQ scores and reading problems  The strongest relationship between these variables and ASPD are childhood hyperactivity and conduct disorder  Additionally, children who grow up with a predisposition of ASPD and interact with other delinquent children are likely to later be diagnosed with ASPD  Like many disorders, genetics play a role in this disorder but the environment holds an undeniable role in its development 

Boys are twice as likely to meet all of the diagnostic criteria for ASPD than girls ( versus ) and they will often start showing symptoms of the disorder much earlier in life  Children that do not show symptoms of the disease through age  will not develop ASPD later in life  If adults exhibit milder symptoms of ASPD, it is likely that they never met the criteria for the disorder in their childhood and were consequently never diagnosed  Overall, symptoms of ASPD tend to peak in late-teens and early twenties, but can often reduce or improve through age  

ASPD is ultimately a lifelong disorder that has chronic consequences, though some of these can be moderated over time  There may be a high variability of the long-term outlook of antisocial personality disorder  The treatment of this disorder can be successful, but it entails unique difficulties  It is unlikely to see rapid change especially when the condition is severe  In fact, past studies revealed that remission rates were small, with up to only  rates of improvement instead of remittance  As a result of the characteristics of ASPD (e g , displaying charm in effort of personal gain, manipulation), patients seeking treatment (mandated or otherwise) may appear to be "cured" in order to get out of treatment  According to definitions found in the DSM-, people with ASPD can be deceitful and intimidating in their relationships  When they are caught doing something wrong, they often appear to be unaffected and unemotional about the consequences  Over time, continual behavior that lacks empathy and concern may lead to someone with ASPD taking advantage of the kindness of others, including his or her therapist 

Without proper treatment, individuals suffering with ASPD could lead a life that brings about harm to themselves or others  This can be detrimental to their families and careers  ASPD victims suffer from lack of interpersonal skills (e g , lack of remorse, lack of empathy, lack of emotional-processing skills)  As a result of the inability to create and maintain healthy relationships due to the lack of interpersonal skills, individuals with ASPD may find themselves in predicaments such as divorce, unemployment, homelessness and even premature death by suicide  They also see higher rates of committed crime, reaching peaks in their late teens and often committing higher-severity crimes in their younger ages of diagnoses  Comorbidity of other mental illnesses such as Depression or substance use disorder is prevalent among ASPD victims  People with ASPD are also more likely to commit homicides and other crimes  Those who are imprisoned longer often see higher rates of improvement with symptoms of ASPD than others who have been imprisoned for a shorter amount of time 

According to one study, aggressive tendencies show in about  of all male patients diagnosed with ASPD  About  of the men studied with ASPD also showed a prevalence of pre-meditated aggression  Based on the evidence in the study, the researchers concluded that aggression in patients with ASPD is mostly impulsive, though there are some long-term evidences of pre-meditated aggressions  It often occurs that those with higher psychopathic traits will exhibit the pre-meditated aggressions to those around them  Over the course of a patient's life with ASPD, he or she can exhibit this aggressive behavior and harm those close to him or her 

Additionally, many people (especially adults) who have been diagnosed with ASPD become burdens to their close relatives, peers, and caretakers  Harvard Medical School recommends that time and resources be spent treating victims who have been affected by someone with ASPD, because the patient with ASPD may not respond to the administered therapies  In fact, a patient with ASPD may only accept treatment when ordered by a court, which will make their course of treatment difficult and severe  Because of the challenges in treatment, the patient's family and close friends must take an active role in decisions about therapies that are offered to the patient  Ultimately, there must be a group effort to aid the long-term effects of the disorder 

As seen in two North American studies and two European studies, ASPD is more commonly seen in men than in women, with men three to five times more likely to be diagnosed with ASPD than women  The prevalence of ASPD is even higher in selected populations, like prisons, where there is a preponderance of violent offenders  It has been found that the prevalence of ASPD among prisoners is just under   Similarly, the prevalence of ASPD is higher among patients in alcohol or other drug (AOD) use treatment programs than in the general population, suggesting a link between ASPD and AOD use and dependence  As part of the Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study, men with ASPD were found to be three to five times more likely to excessively use alcohol and illicit substances than those men without ASPD  While ASPD occurs more often in men than women, there was found to be increased severity of this substance use in women with ASPD  In a study conducted with both men and women with ASPD, women were more likely to misuse substances compared to their male counterparts 

Individuals with ASPD are at an elevated risk for suicide  Some studies suggest this increase in suicidality is in part due to the association between suicide and symptoms or trends within ASPD, such as criminality and substance use  Offspring of ASPD victims are also at risk  Some research suggests that negative or traumatic experiences in childhood, perhaps as a result of the choices a parent with ASPD might make, can be a predictor of delinquency later on in the child's life  Additionally, with variability between situations, children of a parent with ASPD may suffer consequences of delinquency if they're raised in an environment in which crime and violence is common  Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth who display antisocial behavior, especially when mixed with delinquency  Incarceration, which could come as a consequence of actions from a victim of ASPD, is a predictor for suicide ideation in youth 

The first version of the DSM-V in  listed sociopathic personality disturbance  This category was for individuals who were considered " ill primarily in terms of society and of conformity with the prevailing milieu, and not only in terms of personal discomfort and relations with other individuals"  There were four subtypes, referred to as "reactions": antisocial, dyssocial, sexual, and addiction  The antisocial reaction was said to include people who were "always in trouble" and not learning from it, maintaining "no loyalties", frequently callous and lacking responsibility, with an ability to "rationalize" their behavior  The category was described as more specific and limited than the existing concepts of "constitutional psychopathic state" or "psychopathic personality" which had had a very broad meaning; the narrower definition was in line with criteria advanced by Hervey M  Cleckley from , while the term sociopathic had been advanced by George Partridge in  when studying the early environmental influence on psychopaths  Partridge discovered the correlation between antisocial psychopathic disorder and parental rejection experienced in early childhood 

The DSM-II in  rearranged the categories and "antisocial personality" was now listed as one of ten personality disorders but still described similarly, to be applied to individuals who are: "basically unsocialized", in repeated conflicts with society, incapable of significant loyalty, selfish, irresponsible, unable to feel guilt or learn from prior experiences, and who tend to blame others and rationalize  The manual preface contains "special instructions" including "Antisocial personality should always be specified as mild, moderate, or severe " The DSM-II warned that a history of legal or social offenses was not by itself enough to justify the diagnosis, and that a "group delinquent reaction" of childhood or adolescence or "social maladjustment without manifest psychiatric disorder" should be ruled out first  The dyssocial personality type was relegated in the DSM-II to "dyssocial behavior" for individuals who are predatory and follow more or less criminal pursuits, such as racketeers, dishonest gamblers, prostitutes, and dope peddlers  (DSM-I classified this condition as sociopathic personality disorder, dyssocial type)  It would later resurface as the name of a diagnosis in the ICD-X manual produced by the WHO, later spelled dissocial personality disorder and considered approximately equivalent to the ASPD diagnosis 

The DSM-III in  included the full term antisocial personality disorder and, as with other disorders, there was now a full checklist of symptoms focused on observable behaviors to enhance consistency in diagnosis between different psychiatrists ('inter-rater reliability')  The ASPD symptom list was based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria developed from the so-called Feighner Criteria from , and in turn largely credited to influential research by sociologist Lee Robins published in  as "Deviant Children Grown Up"  However, Robins has previously clarified that while the new criteria of prior childhood conduct problems came from her work, she and co-researcher psychiatrist Patricia O'Neal got the diagnostic criteria they used from Lee's husband the psychiatrist Eli Robins, one of the authors of the Feighner criteria who had been using them as part of diagnostic interviews 

The DSM-IV maintained the trend for behavioral antisocial symptoms while noting "This pattern has also been referred to as psychopathy, sociopathy, or dyssocial personality disorder" and re-including in the 'Associated Features' text summary some of the underlying personality traits from the older diagnoses  The DSM-V has the same diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder  The Pocket Guide to the DSM-V Diagnostic Exam suggests that a person with ASPD may present "with psychopathic features" if he or she exhibits "a lack of anxiety or fear and a bold, efficacious interpersonal style"
