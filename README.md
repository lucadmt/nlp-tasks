# NLP Tasks
Here there are some exercises from my university NLP course.

It's the project related to the first part of the course. I implemented a CKY parser and tested it with the "Dothraki" grammar and another grammar extracted from the book [“Speech and Language Processing” by Dan Jurafsky e James H. Martin.](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)

Various exercises regarding the use of lexicographic resources such as [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/), [FrameNet](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/), [BabelNet](https://babelnet.org/), [NASARI](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/nasari/) in tasks such as: Word Similarity, Word-Sense Disambiguation, Automatic Summarization (Extractive), Word-Sense Identification and Annotation Agreement.
